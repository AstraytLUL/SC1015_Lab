"Bitcoin (BTC) Drops Below $60,000, Ethereum (ETH) Says Goodbye to $3,000, Solana (SOL) Strength Disappears: Is Bull Market Over?","U.Today - The Bitcoin roller coaster has taken another dive, breaking below the $60,000 mark and unsettling the market. This recent dip sees the cryptocurrency dipping its toes into the $58,000 territory, the least-expected move by the market. The fall through what many considered a solid support level at $60,000 is causing some panic.

This unsettling movement could have been seen as a dark cloud, but there is a silver lining that has the crypto faithful watching the calendar: the Bitcoin halving. Slated for around April 20, this event is historically known for shaking up the market in unexpected ways. The halving could tighten supply and potentially swing the pendulum back in favor of higher prices.

BTC/USDT Chart by TradingViewLooking at the charts with a magnifying glass, we can see that Bitcoin's next support test lies at $58,572, just a stone's throw from where it is currently. If it fails to hold this line, the descent might continue toward the $50,319 area, where the next safety net lies.

But let's not write off Bitcoin just yet. If it can rally back and crack through the $60,000 ceiling again, it might just push back to its recent comfort zone. The first sign of recovery will be reclaiming ground above this critical level, with eyes then set on the $68,789 marker — a formidable resistance that could block the path to its previous highs.

Ethereum's farewell
Ethereum's slide below $3,000 is more than just a number — it is a signal. It tells us that the confidence that was pushing prices up is shaky. The drop has been steep enough to make even the staunchest supporters a bit nervous about what's coming next.
We have spotted some levels that could tell us where things might head. Right now, Ethereum is testing the waters below the $3,000 line. If it does not climb back up soon, the next floor might be around the $2,800 mark, a point that could offer some resistance to the fall. On the chance that Ethereum finds its feet again, watch out for the $3,200 ceiling — it is the next battle to win for recovery hopes.

There is a real chance that ETH could keep dropping, especially if it does not get back above $3,000 quickly. But with the halving in play, it is too early to count it out. A surge of inflows to the market might change the situation in favor of bulls quicker than anticipated.

Solana remains suppressed
Solana, the cryptocurrency that has been on many investors' watchlists, is showing signs of strain. After a period of growth, SOL has slipped through what was a strong support level at around $130, and now folks are worried. If prices keep heading south and pass below the $100 mark, it could spell real trouble.
Key indicators that many traders look to for signs of healing, like RSI and moving averages, have been breached. Currently, Solana struggles to find a proper footing for the price.

The situation looks tense. With the support at $130 now a thing of the past, the next checkpoint is at $100.

Yet, not all hope is lost. There is still a chance for a turnaround. Growth could be around the corner if Solana manages to rally and break through resistance levels, particularly around $150, which could act as a ladder to climb back up from its current position.

The future of Solana is not set in stone. If it finds strength and pushes above these resistance levels, it might just regain its previous momentum. But if it continues to fall, the drop below $100 could be a hard reality check for the coin and its investors.

New report shows 42% QoQ surge in stablecoin user activity,"A fresh industry report by QuickNode and Artemis highlights impressive growth across various blockchain sectors, particularly in stablecoins, decentralized finance (DeFi), and Web3 gaming. The findings reveal upticks in user engagement and technological adoption, pointing towards a strong expansion in these domains.

The report delves into the stablecoin sector's remarkable 42% quarter-over-quarter spike in user activity. It points to various factors driving this surge, such as the green light for spot Bitcoin ETFs, Bitcoin halving, a shift away from hyperinflated fiat currencies, and a rebound in the DeFi sector. These crypto coins, tied to fiat currencies, now collectively make up over 41% of all daily active addresses in the blockchain realm.

The DeFi sector also reported a 291% increase in user activity from the previous quarter. Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum and Base are expanding rapidly with big increases in total value locked, which points to a growing interest in improving on-chain liquidity.

Moreover, Web3 gaming recorded decent gains, with a 155% rise in active addresses, highlighting its success in integrating blockchain technology to improve gaming experiences with new ownership and financial models.

The report also touches on the burgeoning sector of decentralized social platforms, which have shown a dramatic 425% increase in DAA quarter-over-quarter. These platforms are emerging as viable alternatives to traditional social media by offering users more control over their data and a bigger say in how the platform evolves.

The decentralized social scene is being driven by platforms like Farcaster, Lens, friend.tech, and Tomo. In the past, these decentralized social networks saw a burst of interest initially, but then a drop-off as their ‘exclusive and new’ novelty fades. However, recent trends show a gradual increase in active users after the initial spike, hinting at more sustained engagement and greater adoption in the long run.

Stablecoins have maintained their lead as the most active category in daily web3 user activity, overtaking DeFi since the first quarter of 2023. USDT (Tether) continues to dominate the market, holding roughly 75% of the total stablecoin market cap. In the first quarter of 2024, USDT's market cap surpassed $100 billion, marking it as only the fifth crypto asset to achieve this milestone after Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, and Ripple.

Interestingly, while USDT processed more than ten times the number of transactions compared to USDC, the latter recently overtook it in terms of volume and average transaction size. This is attributed to Coinbase’s efforts in the first quarter of 2024 to integrate USDC more deeply on their platform and promote its use on their Layer 2 network, Base, by subsidizing transaction fees.

Finally, the report highlights how the Solana-based platforms have surged in volume and activity, challenging Ethereum’s long-held dominance. During the first quarter of 2024, 

While OpenSea and Magic Eden have historically led the market in daily active NFT addresses and transaction counts, respectively, the latest data from the first quarter shows Tensor overtaking both in these key performance metrics. 

The surge in Solana marketplaces coincides with increasing excitement around Bitcoin ordinals, which have been making waves since their debut in January 2023. These Bitcoin blockchain-based assets, akin to NFTs, have not only gained immense popularity but have also been a boon for Bitcoin miners financially.

P2P.org introduces DVT-powered restaking solution with SSV network,"Non-custodial staking service P2P.org plans to go live with a new restaking product designed for institutional clients, leveraging the SSV Network and EigenLayer technology, Investing.com has learned.

This approach uses Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) to offer decentralized restaking options within the Ethereum ecosystem.

The restaking product offers an annual percentage yield (APY) of over 5.6%, which enables users to benefit from the rewards associated with securing Ethereum and layer2 blockchain networks. 

By integrating SSV’s DVT with EigenLayer's restaking technology, P2P.org simplifies the participation process for institutions in the cryptocurrency staking space without adding operational complexity or risk.

The new product also helps platforms such as exchanges, wallet providers, and custodians incorporate staking and decentralized finance (DeFi) services into their offerings. P2P.org says it currently manages over 1 million staked ether (ETH) and has exceeded a total value locked (TVL) of $7.4 billion.

Staking lets cryptocurrency investors earn passive income by putting their holdings to work, without having to sell them. Institutional staking works the same way, but on a much larger scale. There are two types of staking providers: non-custodial, where investors keep control of their crypto, and custodial, where the provider holds the crypto on behalf of the investor.

Matrixport, a Hong Kong-based financial services provider specializing in crypto products, is the first major client to adopt P2P.org’s DVT-powered restaking service. This collaboration allows their institutional clients to generate yields through a user-friendly interface that supports compliant decentralized staking practices.

Jonathan Tse, Head of Treasury at Matrixport, commented on the launch, stating, ""It's intriguing to observe Ethereum's shift towards a more collaborative model for node operators, aiming for equal rewards for all stakers. The rapid evolution of technology continually introduces new solutions to address emerging challenges, and I appreciate how P2P.org offers a swift and comprehensive solution that incorporates MEV delay, SSV, and restaking all within a unified platform.""

The deployment of P2P.org’s restaking solution marks one of the first institutional applications of DVT, which plays a crucial role in upgrading the security of ETH staking and the resilience of the entire Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ecosystem against attacks.

SSV.Network, the technology behind this initiative, provides a scalable infrastructure that is easy to use for developers, powered by the DVT technology tailored specifically for Ethereum staking. As an open-source protocol, SSV.Network enables various entities to engage with and contribute to the network’s staking technology."," 04/17/2024, 06:19 AM", 04/17/2024,3083.42,3064.48,-0.614253005,0.019,0.854,0.127,0.9905,"P2P.org introduces DVT-powered restaking solution with SSV network Non-custodial staking service P2P.org plans to go live with a new restaking product designed for institutional clients, leveraging the SSV Network and EigenLayer technology, Investing.com has learned.

"Bitcoin price today: Down to $63k amid rate fears, Iran-Israel clash","&copy; Reuters.  
Investing.com-- Bitcoin price slid on Tuesday as risk appetite remained frail amid higher-for-longer U.S. interest rates and escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, highlighted by renewed Israel-Iran conflicts.

The dollar shot up to an over five-month high this week, pressuring the broader crypto market as strong retail sales and inflation data saw traders price out expectations of early U.S. interest rate cuts.

Bitcoin fell 4.2% in the past 24 hours to $63,118.5 by 08:35 ET (12:35 GMT). Traders remained largely biased towards traditional safe havens such as the dollar and gold.

Hong Kong crypto ETF approval provides little cheer 
Weak risk appetite largely overshadowed the approval of spot crypto exchange-traded funds by Hong Kong regulators on Monday.

The move offers Hong Kong and Chinese investors some exposure to crypto markets, after cryptocurrencies were effectively banned in mainland China in 2021 over issues of gambling and market manipulation.

But while three ETF providers received approval for the products from Hong Kong regulators, they are yet to launch any offerings.

It remains to be seen whether the Hong Kong ETFs can inspire a rally in Bitcoin akin to that seen in U.S. markets earlier this year. The approval of spot U.S. ETFs had sparked a stellar rally in the world’s biggest cryptocurrency over the past two months, although capital flows were now seen slowing as enthusiasm cooled. 

Crypto price today: prices fall as crypto ETFs see outflows 
Broader cryptocurrency prices fell on Tuesday, as risk appetite remained weak amid Iran-Israel tensions, as well as the prospect of higher-for-longer U.S. interest rates. 

Ethereum fell 4.7% to $3,080.26, while XRP and Solana lost 3.9% and 10.8%, respectively.

Crypto prices had seen a flash crash over the weekend following an Iranian strike against Israel, although they recovered some ground after reports showed the damage from the attack was minimal.

But reports this week showed that Israel was now considering retaliation for the attack. 

Hotter-than-expected U.S. retail sales data saw the dollar surge to over five-month highs, while anticipation of an upcoming speech by Fed Chair Jerome Powell also kept traders on edge. 

The weak risk environment saw traders grow more hesitant towards speculative assets such as crypto.

Data from digital asset manager CoinShares also showed on Monday that crypto investment products saw outflows over the past week.

Bitcoin ETFs are fueling additional demand for the underlying cryptocurrency, brokerage firm says
Despite significant attention on the assets under management (AUM) accrued by Bitcoin ETFs, it's becoming clear that these funds are also boosting demand for the underlying cryptocurrency, brokerage firm Canaccord Genuity said in a research report Monday.

The broker further underscored this point at its 2024 Digital Assets Symposium held last Thursday, where leaders from 29 crypto-related companies were in attendance.

“It is becoming clear now that there is a material multiplier effect also underway from the ETFs in driving additional demand for the underlying BTC spot itself,” analysts led by Joseph Vafi said.

The firm said that numerous crypto investors, both institutional and retail, find the underlying spot Bitcoin more appealing than ETFs “given potentially more ways to hedge and generate yield on HODLs over time as the asset class matures.”"," 04/16/2024, 01:39 AM", 04/16/2024,3100.98,2985.42,-3.72656386,0.106,0.779,0.115,0.8687,"Bitcoin price today: Down to $63k amid rate fears, Iran-Israel clash &copy; Reuters.

Ethereum vs. Bitcoin: Is 60% ETH Price Collapse on Horizon?,"U.Today - Benjamin Cowen, a crypto analyst and trader, has raised concerns about the potential significant price collapse of Ethereum (ETH).

In a recent analysis, Cowen hinted at the possibility of a 60% plunge in the price of ETH, citing the loss of crucial support levels for the ETH/BTC trading pair.

The ETH/BTC trading pair, which compares the value of Ethereum to that of Bitcoin, is widely regarded as an important indicator of market sentiment and relative strength between the two largest cryptocurrencies.

According to Cowen's analysis, the recent loss of important support levels in the ETH/BTC pair could signal further downside for Ethereum's price in the near term.

According to the crypto analyst, on the past two occasions, ETH/BTC broke major support, and the ETH/USD pair fell 60% from its previous local high in three to six months. He mentioned that ETH/BTC has just lost support, and the implications of this development are unknown presently.

Cowen's warning comes amid a period of heightened volatility and uncertainty on the cryptocurrency market, with Ethereum experiencing fluctuations in its price and trading volume.

The loss of support for the ETH/BTC pair adds to the uncertainty surrounding the Ethereum price as it fights to maintain the crucial $3,000 level.

ETH was down 3% in the last 24 hours to $3,055 at the time of writing. According to crypto analyst Ali, the next critical support zone for Ethereum is currently between $2,000 and $2,430, where around 9.37 million addresses hold nearly 53 million ETH.

While the prediction of a 60% drop made by Cowen is stark, it is important to realize that predictions are not certainties. While historical trends and potential outcomes might be crucial to consider, past performance might not indicate future results.

In separate news, the Ethereum community is debating a change to the ETH monetary policy in response to proposals aimed at limiting the staking pool's rapid expansion. This discussion was triggered after two Ethereum researchers proposed slowing ETH issuance and thereby reducing staking incentives.

"Most Brutal XRP Price Drop in Years, Is Ethereum (ETH) About to Lose $3,000? Is Bitcoin (BTC) Really Doomed?","U.Today - XRP witnessed its most brutal price drop in years, plummeting by 20% in two days. Typically, XRP is characterized by low volatility, the magnitude of this plunge was particularly catastrophic.

This sharp decline pushed XRP's value down, breaching several crucial support levels. The fall was abrupt, slicing through the anticipated support near the $0.58 mark with ease, and coming to rest just above the $0.48 level.

XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewOur main focus now turns to the asset's next technical support levels. The 200-day EMA stands out as a potential bounce point, roughly at the $0.57 mark, slightly above where the plunge halted. Should XRP stabilize and recover above this line, it could instill a semblance of confidence back into the market.

Despite the shock, growth scenarios remain on the horizon. For a bullish reversal to gain credibility, XRP would need to reclaim its position above the resistance formed near the $0.58 level. But considering the current state of the market, that goal seems surreal.

Ethereum on verge
Ethereum is teetering on the edge, with its price just above $3,050 after a significant drop. This precarious position has the crypto community asking: Is Ethereum about to dip below the symbolic $3,000 mark?
The recent price trajectory has not been kind to Ethereum, as the 100-day exponential moving average (EMA), currently near the $3,050 level, is being tested. This average has often provided some buoyancy, but its strength as a support level is not ironclad. Should Ethereum fail to maintain this level, a drop below $3,000 seems increasingly plausible.

However, it is worth considering the potential for a reversal. The start of a new week could see market dynamics shift as investors look to capitalize on what they perceive as bargain prices. This buying pressure at local lows has the potential to reverse the downtrend, at least temporarily.

From a chart perspective, if Ethereum holds its ground above the $3,050 support, there is room for cautious optimism. A rebound from this level could push prices back toward the resistance at $3,400. This would indicate a resurgence of buying interest and could help avert a more substantial decline.

If Ethereum breaks below the $3,000 threshold, the next significant level of support rests at the 200-day EMA, which is around $2,695. A slip to this lower boundary could mark a more pronounced bearish phase for Ethereum.

Looking ahead, the key for Ethereum is whether it can summon the strength to defend the $3,000 level. If it does, and particularly if it can then surge past the 100 EMA, the narrative might shift back to a positive one.

Bitcoin fails
Bitcoin has surprised us all with the substantial price drop that now makes the majority of market participants worry about the future of this bullish cycle.
The drop to levels around $64,300 may signal a trend reversal, marking the end of the recent bull run.

Despite the recent dip, Bitcoin has not completely left its support levels. The 50-day moving average currently sits near $58,417, offering a glimmer of hope as a potential bounce-back point. If Bitcoin can stabilize and hold above this MA, a reversal remains a possibility.

A deeper look at the chart suggests that the $64,300 drop could open up a scenario where Bitcoin tests the next support level, which is the 100-day MA near $60,000. Holding above this could be crucial for maintaining a bullish outlook. If it does, and investor confidence remains steady, there is a chance for Bitcoin to recover and aim for resistance levels once again, possibly around $67,500, where it recently faced pushback.

Is Bitcoin (BTC) Really Doomed? U.Today - XRP witnessed its most brutal price drop in years, plummeting by 20% in two days. Typically, XRP is characterized by low volatility, the magnitude of this plunge was particularly catastrophic.

This sharp decline pushed XRP's value down, breaching several crucial support levels. The fall was abrupt, slicing through the anticipated support near the $0.58 mark with ease, and coming to rest just above the $0.48 level.

XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewOur main focus now turns to the asset's next technical support levels. The 200-day EMA stands out as a potential bounce point, roughly at the $0.57 mark, slightly above where the plunge halted. Should XRP stabilize and recover above this line, it could instill a semblance of confidence back into the market.

Despite the shock, growth scenarios remain on the horizon. For a bullish reversal to gain credibility, XRP would need to reclaim its position above the resistance formed near the $0.58 level. But considering the current state of the market, that goal seems surreal.

Ethereum on verge
Ethereum is teetering on the edge, with its price just above $3,050 after a significant drop. This precarious position has the crypto community asking: Is Ethereum about to dip below the symbolic $3,000 mark?
The recent price trajectory has not been kind to Ethereum, as the 100-day exponential moving average (EMA), currently near the $3,050 level, is being tested. This average has often provided some buoyancy, but its strength as a support level is not ironclad. Should Ethereum fail to maintain this level, a drop below $3,000 seems increasingly plausible.

However, it is worth considering the potential for a reversal. The start of a new week could see market dynamics shift as investors look to capitalize on what they perceive as bargain prices. This buying pressure at local lows has the potential to reverse the downtrend, at least temporarily.

From a chart perspective, if Ethereum holds its ground above the $3,050 support, there is room for cautious optimism. A rebound from this level could push prices back toward the resistance at $3,400.

Dogecoin Founder's Comment on Crypto Market Crash Stirs DOGE Community,"U.Today - Billy Markus, known on the X social media platform as “Shibetoshi Nakamoto,” co-created meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin in 2013. Markus is famous for his playful and sarcastic takes regarding the cryptocurrency market.

On Friday, when the crypto market turned red with DOGE falling by over 19%, Markus offered his audience another peculiar comment on the state of things. His statement triggered a supportive response from the DOGE community.

DOGE co-founder's comment on BTC, ETH, DOGE crash
Markus published a screenshot of the two largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, experiencing a major correction after the recent price surges. Dogecoin is behaving likewise. The S&P 500 index is also here, sinking into the red.
The cryptocurrency influencer Markus’ tweet is full of sarcasm, and it says, “oh no everything died we are dead.” In his manifold previous tweets over the past years, the DOGE creator has made his attitude toward crypto trading clear — he believes it to be a sort of gambling where nobody really knows why prices go up or down and cannot really predict rises and falls, since in most cases they come totally out of the blue.

On Friday, the world’s leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin suddenly entered a massive correction as it plunged from slightly above $70,000 to the $67,490 zone, losing 7% of its value worth $2,500. Later on, BTC pared some of its losses, recovering to $67,472, where it is changing hands as of this writing.

Ethereum followed suit, plunging by over 10% from $3,525 to the $3,161 level but later recovering a little and now trading at $3,259. Overall, approximately $735 million worth of cryptocurrencies has been liquidated within the last 24 hours across the market.

DOGE crashed by slightly over 19%, hitting $0.1610 briefly. Two attempts to recover undertaken by Dogecoin have led it to $0.1712.

Bitcoin halving drawing closer
This Bitcoin crash and the crypto market correction that followed have come less than a week before the approaching fourth BTC halving scheduled for April 21.
This event that happens once in every four years will again cut the newly minted amount of Bitcoin per block in half, this time taking it down to 3.125 BTC per newly generated block. Many are expecting BTC to skyrocket after that with altcoins to follow suit.

Crypto VC inflows 'look rather subdued' says JPMorgan,"J.P. Morgan raised concerns over the subdued venture capital funding in the cryptocurrency sector this year, despite a strong rebound in crypto prices.

According to the bank’s analysts, the relatively tepid investment flow into the crypto industry could pose a downside risk to the sustainability of the current market boom.

The J.P. Morgan team highlighted that venture capital flows into the crypto industry appear quite restrained year-to-date when compared to previous years. ""Our various proxies for crypto VC flows look rather subdued YTD [year to date] relative to previous years,"" stated the report released on Thursday.

The analysts added that a recovery in venture capital funding is critical for a sustained recovery in the crypto markets.

Recent data indicates that the crypto sector has attracted $3.2 billion in venture capital investment so far this year, which trails the over $4 billion recorded in the first four months of last year.

Despite this, there's a bit of good news: more venture capital firms are getting into the game, either raising or having recently raised fresh funds focused on the crypto market.

Moreover, major players such as Galaxy Digital, Hack VC, and Hivemind Capital are also in the process of raising decent funds for their new crypto-focused investment vehicles.

The crypto accelerator Alliance achieved the first close of its third fund in February, securing $10 million each from Brevan Howard Digital and Galaxy Digital, with plans to raise an additional $80 million by July.

While the pace of venture capital funding is picking up, crypto hedge funds have been particularly active this year. Their assets under management have seen a sharp increase over the past six months, now estimated at around $20 billion.

In the same report, J.P. Morgan analysts also touched on regulatory developments, noting that the likelihood of a spot Ethereum ETF being approved by May is no more than 50%. This follows the SEC's investigation of the Ethereum Foundation.

Market sentiment around the approval appears to be waning, as seen in the growing discount to NAV (Net Asset Value) for the Grayscale Ethereum Trust.

Coingames addresses the largest challenge facing the online casino industry today, which is conversion rate. As the only true Web3 casino, players do not need to deposit funds to play because the whole game session is handled through the smart contract, removing a major barrier to participation. This innovative approach has led to a 380% improvement in conversion rates and a 200% increase in customer Lifetime Value (LTV).

Users enjoy shorter wait times for registration and deposit without the need for third parties that complicate and slow down processes at every turn. Players maintain full autonomy over their funds with no restrictions on when or how much they can withdraw using their non-custodial wallets.

This is the future of gaming, secure, user-focused, and boundlessly exciting. We're proud to lead this charge and invite players to experience the difference at CoinGames, where innovation meets entertainment.”
CoinGames is currently enjoyed by 20,000 users with ambitions to entertain 1,000,000 by year's end. The platform has secured a specialized gambling license, which has allowed Coingames to operate its unique crypto-based gambling model within a regulated environment. This has been paramount to the maintaining of trust and security of the platform’s users and has provided a solid foundation upon which to build the future of decentralized online gaming.
CoinGames is currently launching its CoinGames Token, initially available to private investors and subsequently to the public through pre-sale and public sale phases. Soon, their NFT collection will also be ready for direct purchase on Magic Eden.

Nektar Network Unveiled to Elevate Ethereum’s Trust Layer and Combat Centralization,"Berlin, Germany, April 11th, 2024, Chainwire

Nektar Network - the multilayered Re-staking network is designed to optimize Ethereum's security model while scaling distributed solutions, paving the way for more decentralized infrastructure.

The team behind Diva Staking unveils the Nektar Network, a pioneering restaking ecosystem poised to redefine the Ethereum trust model and extend its utility across distributed systems. The Nektar Network launches with a vision to democratize Ethereum’s validation process while addressing the challenges of centralization and resilience.

Popularized by EigenLayer, already with $14 billion in re-staked ETH, Re-staking implies repurposing a staked asset to secure additional tasks or duties by the validators using such staked assets as collateral. Users can opt into Nektar to augment their staking activities, earning additional rewards from AVSs.

Nektar Network tackles critical challenges within the blockchain space by empowering different agents. Nektar facilitates the seamless establishment of PoS-based distributed systems, enhancing trust and security for applications utilizing its services.

The crypto ecosystem is rapidly evolving into a more sophisticated and developed landscape. There are now specialized actors vital for a smooth bootstrapping of the network. We are confident that with their help, the Nektar Community will grow at lightning speed to become one of the most relevant actors within the Ethereum ecosystem.

Nektar Network aims to be a response to the growing problem of centralization in the Ethereum ecosystem. While there are major concerns about a limited number of actors controlling the validation layer, at a Re-staking level the ecosystem was in need of viable alternatives to diversify the growing interest in Re-staking. Nektar Network intends to position itself as the most resilient alternative within this vital component of Ethereum’s scaling.

Furthermore, the integration of Distributed Validation Technology (DVT) within Nektar enhances Ethereum's resilience, presenting a robust infrastructure for developers, operators, and validators to engage with the Ethereum network more securely and efficiently.

The Ethereum ecosystem has reached a critical juncture. On one hand, liquid staking has democratized access to Ethereum validation. On the other, it has created a centralization problem where a handful of entities could, in theory, collude to control the network. Continuing down this path would contradict one of Ethereum’s core tenets and send the wrong message to stakeholders. Nektar provides a restaking network as decentralized as possible, powered by DVT.

Nektar Network - the multilayered Re-staking network is designed to optimize Ethereum's security model while scaling distributed solutions, paving the way for more decentralized infrastructure.

The team behind Diva Staking unveils the Nektar Network, a pioneering restaking ecosystem poised to redefine the Ethereum trust model and extend its utility across distributed systems. The Nektar Network launches with a vision to democratize Ethereum’s validation process while addressing the challenges of centralization and resilience.

Popularized by EigenLayer, already with $14 billion in re-staked ETH, Re-staking implies repurposing a staked asset to secure additional tasks or duties by the validators using such staked assets as collateral. Users can opt into Nektar to augment their staking activities, earning additional rewards from AVSs.

Nektar Network tackles critical challenges within the blockchain space by empowering different agents. Nektar facilitates the seamless establishment of PoS-based distributed systems, enhancing trust and security for applications utilizing its services.

The crypto ecosystem is rapidly evolving into a more sophisticated and developed landscape. There are now specialized actors vital for a smooth bootstrapping of the network. We are confident that with their help, the Nektar Community will grow at lightning speed to become one of the most relevant actors within the Ethereum ecosystem.

Nektar Network aims to be a response to the growing problem of centralization in the Ethereum ecosystem. While there are major concerns about a limited number of actors controlling the validation layer, at a Re-staking level the ecosystem was in need of viable alternatives to diversify the growing interest in Re-staking. Nektar Network intends to position itself as the most resilient alternative within this vital component of Ethereum’s scaling.

Furthermore, the integration of Distributed Validation Technology (DVT) within Nektar enhances Ethereum's resilience, presenting a robust infrastructure for developers, operators, and validators to engage with the Ethereum network more securely and efficiently.

The Ethereum ecosystem has reached a critical juncture. On one hand, liquid staking has democratized access to Ethereum validation. On the other, it has created a centralization problem where a handful of entities could, in theory, collude to control the network. Continuing down this path would contradict one of Ethereum’s core tenets and send the wrong message to stakeholders. Nektar provides a restaking network as decentralized as possible, powered by DVT.

Solana is leading the battle for blockchain payments - analysts,"The global stablecoin market is regaining steam pretty fast and making quick inroads into the global settlement industry.  

A recent report from Bernstein Research shows that stablecoins have hit a global settlement value of over $7 trillion, with total circulation increasing and major payment platforms adopting digital currencies for cross-border transactions. This figure is also huge when compared against the combined $14 trillion settled by giants like Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA).

Analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra argue that stablecoins, digital coins designed to maintain a stable value relative to traditional currencies, are not only bridging the gap between fiat and crypto but are also increasingly being used in international settlements.

""The total stablecoin supply, which had peaked at $180 billion in 2021 before dipping to $120 billion in 2022, is on an upward trajectory once again, currently standing at $150 billion,"" the report stated. Leading the market are USDT (Tether) with a 75% market share and USDC (Circle) with 22%.

Despite the so-called ""crypto winter,"" the value transferred using stablecoins has remained robust. In the first quarter of 2024, the annualized value transferred is expected to match the 2022 high of roughly $7 trillion.

Solana leading the battle
Solana has emerged as a major player in blockchain payments, challenging Ethereum's dominance by securing a 43% market share in stablecoin transfers. This shift was attributed to Solana's higher throughput and lower transaction costs, coupled with strong interest from major payment processors like Visa and Shopify (NYSE:SHOP).

The report also highlighted innovative use cases outside the cryptocurrency trading sphere. ""We are witnessing a shift as stablecoins evolve from purely speculative assets to becoming integral to payment processes,"" said Chhugani. Notable developments include PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) launch of PY-USD on Ethereum and Visa's pilot of USDC on Solana for cross-border settlements.

Despite these advances, the report cautions that scalability remains a challenge for broader consumer payment applications, with current blockchain transaction speeds needing major improvement to match those of traditional payment networks.

Stablecoins try to keep their value steady, but how well they stick to their peg depends on what's backing them up, or sometimes, what's not. The report notes that market swings, how much people trust and use them, tech developments, demand and supply, and how easy they are to buy and sell—all these factors play a role.

One big worry with stablecoins is when they slip from their supposed value. Looking at five different stablecoins, it turns out moments when they drop below a buck happen more often and last longer compared to times they bump up above that dollar mark."," 04/09/2024, 09:13 AM", 04/09/2024,3694.92,3545.16,-4.053132409,0.036,0.808,0.156,0.9949,"Solana is leading the battle for blockchain payments - analysts The global stablecoin market is regaining steam pretty fast and making quick inroads into the global settlement industry.

Will the upcoming Bitcoin halving be a sell-the-news event?,"Bitcoin's price skyrocketed in a strong rally above the $71,000 threshold ahead of its much-anticipated fourth halving. The demand for the original cryptocurrency also picked up amid a flurry of activity in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sectors.

Elsewhere, Ethena's ENA token jumped this week following its airdrop, and Ripple's announcement of a new stablecoin alongside Ethereum Foundation's proposal to cut ETH newly minted units has fueled positive sentiment across the market.

The upcoming Bitcoin halving has investors and analysts on edge, with historical data showing a mixed immediate impact but overwhelmingly bullish long-term effects. Past halvings resulted in price surges ranging from 292% to over 8,000%, raising questions about whether the trend will continue.

""Bitcoin's halving event has historically been a precursor to significant market movements,"" said a Kaiko analyst. ""While the past is not always a perfect predictor, the anticipation itself can drive substantial volatility and interest.""

The impact of ETFs and the halving event could combine to exert further pressure on Bitcoin's already limited supply, which could ultimately lead to higher prices.

Despite the excitement, the ETF sector has observed mixed flows, with large outflows from Grayscale's GBTC. However, the overall trend remains positive amid sustained demand for Bitcoin exposure among institutional and retail investors alike.

Famous analyst draws attention to ETH/BTC: Warns of a ‘bear trap’,"Peter Brandt, an analyst known for his Bitcoin analysis, shared his latest analysis of Ethereum and drew attention to the ""bear trap"" formation in the ETH/BTC pair.

Brandt warned that Ethereum could rise rapidly with increasing whale demand, drawing attention to the bear trap in ETH/BTC. After the Dencun update, which was met with great expectations, Ethereum fell below $3,500. Ethereum, which started to underperform Bitcoin, thus recorded its lowest level against BTC since April 2021. However, Peter Brandt claimed that the current outlook in Ethereum could be a ""bear trap"".


Is Ethereum Gearing Up for a Rise?
Peter Brandt, in his latest post shared on platform X, claimed that the Ethereum price could continue its journey by forming a ""bear trap,"" following his comments about Ethereum being an insignificant currency and a Bitcoin copycat. Despite his view of Ethereum being valueless, Brandt also added that the largest altcoin would always see demand.

Ethereum accelerated its trend that began in October, fueled by expectations of the Dencun update and potential spot ETF approval in the first quarter of the year. However, by March, the cryptocurrency started retreating after the Dencun update and amid increasing rumors that the spot ETF wouldn't be approved, ultimately falling back to the $3,000 mark. Additionally, Ethereum reached its lowest level against Bitcoin in nearly three years and witnessed a decline in its dominance rate. This is attributed to Solana's rapid rise and increasing market share, alongside the Bitcoin network's halving event.

Commenting on Ethereum, Peter Brandt added that there are enough large whales invested in the cryptocurrency, making it difficult for the price to fall significantly. Blockchain data seemingly supports Brandt's remarks, indicating a rise in whale activity on the Ethereum network following the ETH/BTC's drop to record lows.

The Latest on Ethereum
After halting its downward momentum around the $3,200 zone last week, Ethereum carried its positive weekend trend into the new week.

On the first day of the week, the cryptocurrency rose rapidly alongside the broader market, reaching a value of $3,650 by the time US trading hours began, reflecting an increase of over 5%. This zone also coincides with the resistance level observed since the week of March 18th.

Ripple CEO predicts crypto market doubling by year end,"Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse forecasts the crypto market's value could once again double by the end of 2024. Garlinghouse's prediction comes at a time when the industry is riding a wave of positive momentum, including major institutional investments and a favorable shift in U.S. regulatory landscapes.

The bullish outlook also comes despite Ripple's ongoing legal tussle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over its XRP sales.

Garlinghouse's optimism is partly fueled by broader industry trends, such as the successful launch of Bitcoin ETFs and the increasing institutional money flowing into the market for the first time. 

Ripple announced last week its plan to launch its own dollar-pegged stablecoin within the year as it seeks to bridge various cryptocurrencies across the XRP ledger and the Ethereum blockchain. 

The crypto market's surge has been monumental, with the collective value of major players like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin nearly doubling to approach the $3 trillion mark. This surge comes amidst trader speculation over Chinese asset managers’ interest in crypto ETFs and the anticipated supply squeeze resulting from the Bitcoin halving.

Bitcoin had already been setting new records, and specific segments of the cryptocurrency world, like meme coins and AI-themed tokens, had seen extraordinary profits. However, XRP had been conspicuously missing from the rally. Despite trailing behind the broader cryptocurrency market's explosive growth over the last year, Ripple's XRP has managed to notch a 20% increase.

"Xterio to Launch Gaming-Oriented Blockchain in Collaboration with AltLayer, aiming for Wider Web3 Gaming Adoption","Singapore, Singapore, April 4th, 2024, Chainwire

Xterio, a leading Web3 gaming publisher and platform, and AltLayer, an open and decentralized protocol for launching native and ZK rollup stacks, have announced the launch of a game-focused restaked rollup designed specifically for Web3 games.

Xterio is a Web3 gaming ecosystem & infrastructure, distinguishing itself as a gaming publisher with top-notch development skills, unparalleled distribution expertise, and over $80M raised in ecosystem funding. With five AAA games and over 45 gaming partners, Xterio has amassed a gaming community of over two million users worldwide and developed the most successful gaming NFT launchpad. Co-founded by industry veterans like Michael Tong, former COO of NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) and CSO of FunPlus, and Jeremy Horn, former Vice President of Jam City, Xterio is committed to accelerating the integration of Web3 technology into gaming and onboarding billions of gamers.

The Xterio chain will be run and managed by AltLayer. It will operate as a Layer 2 settling on Ethereum and utilize the OP Stack as the rollup framework with EigenDA as the Data Availability (DA) layer. Unlike a classical rollup, Xterio chain will instead take the form of a ""restaked rollup"", a framework pioneered by AltLayer. As a restaked rollup, the Xterio chain will come with MACH - an Actively Validated Services (AVS) offering faster finality with economic security by leveraging EigenLayer's restaking mechanism. The rollup will focus on web3 and AI-powered games, with plans to build an on-chain ecosystem around AAA games leveraging the $XTER token.

In addition to being integrated across multiple Xterio titles, the Xterio chain will act as the backbone of the Xterio ecosystem, offering a gateway to a vibrant gaming ecosystem and empowering players to effortlessly collect, own, and trade digital assets in a safe and accessible environment and allowing developers to mint, distribute, and manage millions of assets seamlessly. The chain, alongside the comprehensive Xterio tech platform, intends to make on-chain elements almost invisible thanks to account abstracted wallets, seamless off-chain and on-chain systems, cheap transactions, single-click purchases, flexible payment marketplace and launchpad, and more. In addition to facilitating transactions, the Xterio marketplace and NFT launchpad will embrace the Xterio token as a versatile payment method, accepted for both purchases and gas fees, ensuring a smooth and convenient user experience.

Looking ahead, the Xterio chain will open its doors to game developers seeking a sophisticated yet user-friendly solution to power their creations. Through the Xterio chain, developers will have access to the most extensive first-party gaming catalog in Web3 and tap into its over 2 million user base, which is currently rapidly growing.

With its promise of easy integration and cutting-edge capabilities, the Xterio chain stands ready to drive the future of gaming.

Yaoqi Jia, CEO of AltLayer, said: “Xterio serves as a robust, highly respected platform to its numerous, highly-regarded content partners in the gaming space. As the nature of gaming evolves and calls for higher-performing game mechanics, game economics, and in-game transactions grow, we’re delighted that Xterio has embraced rollups to strengthen its products’ technical capabilities. With AltLayer’s novel restaked rollup product MACH, Xterio will also enjoy security and much faster finality features built using EigenLayer’s restaking mechanism that will ultimately underpin a better gaming experience to benefit developers and players alike.”
Michael Tong, CEO of Xterio, expressed: “Through our collaboration with AltLayer, Xterio is spearheading the development of a cutting-edge blockchain infrastructure to fuel our Web3 gaming titles and extending its availability to partners and collaborators. By harnessing the expansive ETH ecosystem and addressing critical user concerns like gas fees and rapid transaction finality, Xterio is poised to emerge as a frontrunner in high-quality Web3 and beyond.”
Highly regarded for its on-chain gaming capabilities by industry bigwigs, this Binance Labs-backed platform is now building out its game and technology functions, including artificial intelligence (AI) integration and token launch.

Xterio, a leading Web3 gaming publisher and platform, and AltLayer, an open and decentralized protocol for launching native and ZK rollup stacks, have announced the launch of a game-focused restaked rollup designed specifically for Web3 games.

Xterio is a Web3 gaming ecosystem & infrastructure, distinguishing itself as a gaming publisher with top-notch development skills, unparalleled distribution expertise, and over $80M raised in ecosystem funding. With five AAA games and over 45 gaming partners, Xterio has amassed a gaming community of over two million users worldwide and developed the most successful gaming NFT launchpad. Co-founded by industry veterans like Michael Tong, former COO of NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) and CSO of FunPlus, and Jeremy Horn, former Vice President of Jam City, Xterio is committed to accelerating the integration of Web3 technology into gaming and onboarding billions of gamers.

The Xterio chain will be run and managed by AltLayer. It will operate as a Layer 2 settling on Ethereum and utilize the OP Stack as the rollup framework with EigenDA as the Data Availability (DA) layer. Unlike a classical rollup, Xterio chain will instead take the form of a ""restaked rollup"", a framework pioneered by AltLayer. As a restaked rollup, the Xterio chain will come with MACH - an Actively Validated Services (AVS) offering faster finality with economic security by leveraging EigenLayer's restaking mechanism. The rollup will focus on web3 and AI-powered games, with plans to build an on-chain ecosystem around AAA games leveraging the $XTER token.

In addition to being integrated across multiple Xterio titles, the Xterio chain will act as the backbone of the Xterio ecosystem, offering a gateway to a vibrant gaming ecosystem and empowering players to effortlessly collect, own, and trade digital assets in a safe and accessible environment and allowing developers to mint, distribute, and manage millions of assets seamlessly. The chain, alongside the comprehensive Xterio tech platform, intends to make on-chain elements almost invisible thanks to account abstracted wallets, seamless off-chain and on-chain systems, cheap transactions, single-click purchases, flexible payment marketplace and launchpad, and more. In addition to facilitating transactions, the Xterio marketplace and NFT launchpad will embrace the Xterio token as a versatile payment method, accepted for both purchases and gas fees, ensuring a smooth and convenient user experience.

Looking ahead, the Xterio chain will open its doors to game developers seeking a sophisticated yet user-friendly solution to power their creations. Through the Xterio chain, developers will have access to the most extensive first-party gaming catalog in Web3 and tap into its over 2 million user base, which is currently rapidly growing.

With its promise of easy integration and cutting-edge capabilities, the Xterio chain stands ready to drive the future of gaming.

Yaoqi Jia, CEO of AltLayer, said: “Xterio serves as a robust, highly respected platform to its numerous, highly-regarded content partners in the gaming space. As the nature of gaming evolves and calls for higher-performing game mechanics, game economics, and in-game transactions grow, we’re delighted that Xterio has embraced rollups to strengthen its products’ technical capabilities. With AltLayer’s novel restaked rollup product MACH, Xterio will also enjoy security and much faster finality features built using EigenLayer’s restaking mechanism that will ultimately underpin a better gaming experience to benefit developers and players alike.”
Michael Tong, CEO of Xterio, expressed: “Through our collaboration with AltLayer, Xterio is spearheading the development of a cutting-edge blockchain infrastructure to fuel our Web3 gaming titles and extending its availability to partners and collaborators. By harnessing the expansive ETH ecosystem and addressing critical user concerns like gas fees and rapid transaction finality, Xterio is poised to emerge as a frontrunner in high-quality Web3 and beyond.”
Highly regarded for its on-chain gaming capabilities by industry bigwigs, this Binance Labs-backed platform is now building out its game and technology functions, including artificial intelligence (AI) integration and token launch.

Cryptoverse: Ether fettered by fate of spot ETF proposals,"By Lisa Pauline Mattackal and Medha Singh

(Reuters) -Cryptocurrency ether is struggling to keep pace with soaring big brother bitcoin.

The no. 2 cryptocurrency, which commands less than a fifth of the $2.7 trillion crypto market, has not done poorly. But ether is up just around 53% in the first three months of this year, compared with bitcoin's 65%.

Bitcoin scaled new peaks last month. Trading around $3,612 on Monday, ether is at least 26% below its Nov. 2021 all-time high of $4,867.60.

Even a recent technical upgrade of the Ethereum blockchain, which is used to build applications, barely made a splash beyond the circle of crypto enthusiasts, in contrast to the excitement ahead of bitcoin's ""halving"" next month, a technical change designed to slow the coin's supply.

In a typical case of markets selling the fact, ether dropped 12% after the underlying blockchain's Dencun upgrade on March 13 aimed at lowering transaction fees on its ecosystem.

""Ethereum is persistently dogged by its lack of name recognition among non-endemic investors,"" said Joseph Edwards, head of research at London crypto firm Enigma Securities.

""There's a lot more economic activity on it compared to 2020... but it reaching all-time highs will likely come fairly late.""

Much depends on whether the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves spot ether ETFs. For, it was the approval and launch of several U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs that spurred institutional demand and drove it to record highs.

Ether ETFs too are waiting, with VanEck's filing first in line for a decision on May 23.

Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Bank expects U.S. ether ETFs to be approved on May 23, propelling it to $8,000 by end-2024 and $14,000 by end-2025.

COMMODITY OR SECURITY?

Not everyone is as optimistic about the U.S. regulator greenlighting a spot ether ETF.

Lawyers and industry sources have said ether's legal status is ambiguous and they expect regulators to move cautiously.

The SEC has said bitcoin is a commodity, but has not ruled on ether.

Unlike bitcoin, ether is traded on a so-called 'proof-of-stake' blockchain that allows users to earn yield in exchange for locking up tokens for a period of time.

And because ether is often 'staked', or deposited, it could be deemed a security, which will entail stricter rules around disclosure that fly in the face of cryptocurrency's ethos of bypassing the traditional gatekeepers of finance, such as banks and exchanges.

But that complicates the calculus for ETFs, as the yield on staked ether is often higher than that of just plain passive tokens.

""Getting the SEC on board to allow staked ether ETFs will be a very tough bargain and is, for now, extremely unlikely,"" said Anders Helset, head of research at digital assets analytics firm K33

Institutional demand for ether has been a fraction of that for rival bitcoin. Digital asset funds tracking ether have seen outflows of $46.4 million in the month to March 23, according to CoinShares data, versus inflows of over $4 billion for products tracking bitcoin.

Some market participants believe in focusing on ethereum technology, which forms the backbone of much of the internet's 'Web3' vision and powers applications involving crypto offshoots such as decentralised finance and blockchain gaming.

BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) unveiled its first tokenized fund on the ethereum blockchain last month, sparking conversation around the platform's use in broader tokenisation of real world assets.

So far over $2 billion worth of commodities and government securities, among other traditional assets, have been tokenized on several networks, of which 80% are on the ethereum blockchain, according to Swiss cryptocurrency manager 21Shares."," 04/02/2024, 01:06 AM", 04/02/2024,"3,502.84","3,310.62",-5.487547247,0.02,0.883,0.097,0.9935,"Cryptoverse: Ether fettered by fate of spot ETF proposals By Lisa Pauline Mattackal and Medha Singh

"Bitcoin price today: Holds up above $70,000 as range-bound trading persists","Bitcoin price fell slightly on Friday while most financial markets stay shut for a public holiday. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is sliding along with risk-correlated currencies and settling back into the middle of the narrow range above the $70,000 mark where it’s been trading throughout the week. 

The rangebound trading comes amid tepid flows into the U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs and increased outflows of Grayscale's GBTC fund. Europe and U.S. stock markets will remain closed on Friday, March 29, in recognition of Good Friday.

Cryptocurrencies saw a modest rally earlier in the week, with Bitcoin (BTC) price soaring above $70,000 for the first time in ten days. This marks a rebound from recent downturns, scoring a more than 7% increase for the week. Ethereum (ETH) also enjoyed gains, rising by 6% in the same timeframe. 

Short-term intraday traders probably viewed the dip as a chance to buy into Bitcoin at an attractive entry point, creating a widespread sentiment that the worst of this downward correction is firmly in the past.

The positive momentum wasn't limited to Bitcoin and Ethereum; major layer-1 blockchain tokens such as Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) saw advances exceeding 10%. 

The comeback resulted in the liquidation of $195 million in leveraged derivatives positions across various cryptocurrencies, with around $129 million of these betting on falling prices. Bitcoin short liquidations amounted to $53 million, which is below the average daily total seen in the recent weeks.

The modest number of short liquidations despite the price increase indicates that few traders were betting against the market with leverage, expecting further downturns. The price jump this week may mark the end of the downturn cycle in the cryptocurrency market, which saw Bitcoin's value fall below $61,000 from highs above $73,000. 

Bitcoin price rally could extend further
Bitcoin might be setting its sights on new record highs after it breaks out from a consolidation pattern it has formed on the daily chart. The upside scenario is supported by a number of central banks adopting a more dovish stance toward the monetary policy, which is expected to favor Bitcoin.

Despite the recent swings in the crypto market, analysts are still positive about Bitcoin's future prospects.

Markus Thielen, CEO of 10X Research, recently posted an analysis on the X platform, hinting at a possible Bitcoin price rally. His analysis particularly focuses on Bitcoin's performance history in April, suggesting the cryptocurrency might see a 12% increase.

Thielen points out that April has historically been a good month for Bitcoin, with six out of the last ten years showing strong price gains. 

Furthermore, the current fluctuations in Bitcoin's value are being linked by some analysts to the pre-halving phase. Experts note that the pre-halving retracement, a pattern found in past data, highlights Bitcoin's volatility, which often leads up to substantial price surges."," 03/29/2024, 08:54 AM", 03/29/2024,"3,559.43","3,506.83",-1.477764698,0.015,0.868,0.117,0.9924,"Bitcoin price today: Holds up above $70,000 as range-bound trading persists Bitcoin price fell slightly on Friday while most financial markets stay shut for a public holiday.

Massive Bitcoin and Ethereum options expiry to trigger market volatility - report,"The quarterly expiration of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) options contracts, valued at billions of dollars, is set to trigger bullish price volatility this Friday at 08:00 UTC on crypto derivatives exchange Deribit.

This event marks one of Deribit's largest expiries, with $15.2 billion worth of contracts set to be settled, according to CoinDesk. 

Bitcoin options, which represent 62% of the total notional open interest due for settlement, account for $9.5 billion, while Ether options make up the remaining portion.

The impending expiry will reduce the total notional open interest across all maturities by 40% and 43% for Bitcoin and Ether, respectively. This reduction in open interest is noteworthy as it reflects the dollar value of all active contracts at a given time on Deribit, where a single option contract equals one BTC or one ETH.

According to Deribit's chief commercial officer, the bulk of these options are expected to expire in the money (ITM), which effectively triggers upward pressure or volatility in the market. An ITM call option allows the investor to buy BTC or ETH at a strike price lower than the current market rate, resulting in a profit.

With Bitcoin's market rate around $70,000, roughly $3.9 billion worth of Bitcoin options are on track to expire ITM, constituting 41% of the total quarterly open interest. 

Similarly, 15% of ETH's total quarterly open interest, valued at $5.7 billion, is set to expire at ITM. These high levels of ITM expiries, which are unusual compared to previous cycles, may lead to increased market volatility, especially given the recent price rallies in both Bitcoin and Ethereum.

The concept of ""max pain"" points to the strike price at which the highest number of options (both call and put) would expire worthless, causing maximum financial loss to option buyers. For this quarter's expiry, the max pain points are set at $50,000 for BTC and $2,600 for ETH. Historically, prices have tended to move toward these max pain points before rallying after the expiry, suggesting a pattern that might repeat.

Dealer hedging activities are also expected to contribute to market volatility. David Brickell, head of international distribution at FRNT Financial, highlighted the dealers' gamma positioning. With dealers short around $50 million of gamma, primarily concentrated at the $70,000 strike for Bitcoin, the forced hedging around this level could lead to ""whippy, choppy moves"" as the expiry approaches. 

Gamma refers to the rate of change in an option's delta, which measures the sensitivity of an option's price to changes in the underlying asset's price. Market makers, who typically maintain a neutral exposure while providing liquidity, could amplify price movements through their hedging activities.

ERC-7231: Ethereum Community Backs CARV’s NFT Standard for Value Redistribution to Users in the AI Revolution,"Santa Clara, US, March 28th, 2024, Chainwire

CARV, the modular data layer for gaming and AI, today announces the final approval of ERC-7231 – the protocol that establishes a revolutionary system of data self-sovereignty, empowering users to possess, manage, and contribute their information to both AI systems and data consumers, thereby enabling the equitable sharing of generated value.

Ethereum Community greenlighting the standard is a major step in bridging disparate digital identities and enabling users to own their online history, relationships, and experiences across platforms.

ERC-7231 binds multiple Web2 and Web3 identities to a single non-fungible token (NFT) and achieves encrypted aggregation of multi-domain identity data. The result is an “identity of identities” that enables self-authentication, social overlapping, and commercial value generation from targeted user data.

“At long last, this solution breaks down identity silos, rewrites the rules of data ownership, and lays the foundation for a user-owned internet where individuals can have an equitable share in value distribution,” said CARV Co-Founder Victor Yu.
ERC-7231 offers three important benefits at the dawn of Web3. First, the protocol’s integration with account abstraction wallets makes Web2 and Web3 onboarding (and therefore adoption) easier. Second, uniting multiple identities under one banner enables greater interoperability between different platforms and services. Third, users exercise unprecedented control over their data to decide how it’s used. If they opt to share this data, for example, users can passively earn whenever brands leverage their on-chain and off-chain identity information.
Case in point: CARV ID is integrated with the standard and already empowering users to manage their digital presence across the gaming universe with ease and confidence. More than 900,000 CARV ID holders are playing their favorite games and earning rewards across CARV’s comprehensive ecosystem, which spans from its foundational data stack, its gaming-focused application layer, to the increasing list of games integrated with CARV ID. CARV has also developed an AI Agent in house, where more nuanced data can be scrapped in a privacy-preserving way and attributed to CARV ID. Entities building on CARV’s modular data layer, such as MARBLEX which recently just announced their strategic partnership with CARV, can tap into this rich data source for game and AI development. ERC-7231 is “the key to stringing everything together,” said Yu.

Understanding gamers today is increasingly difficult due to app tracking changes (IDFA) and shifting privacy regulations (CCPA). With ERC-7231, users can not only aggregate, own, and control their identities, but gaming and AI companies can leverage this zero- and first-party data to create customized experiences and more accurately target gamers.

For example, according to the company, improved user acquisition was the aim of Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) and its latest game, EA Sports FC Tactical, in Indonesia. Utilizing CARV as one of the primary channels for user acquisition, EA recently recruited Indonesian gamers for the beta test at a lower Cost Per Install (CPI) than traditional channels. Better yet, the game can better understand each gamer and their history thanks to ERC-7231’s aggregated data from multiple gaming accounts.

“Backed by this standard, brands can shift and shape their offering with quality and compliant data, and users can share in the value creation from this information. We welcome all user identity solutions to adopt ERC-7231 and usher in a new age of identity-aggregated NFTs,” said Yu.
About CARV
CARV is the largest modular data layer for gaming and AI, revolutionizing how data is used and shared. CARV ensures privacy, ownership, and control are firmly in the hands of individuals and provides gaming and AI development with holistic and high-quality data reinforced with human feedback in a regulatory-compliant, trustless way. To pioneer a future where data generates value for all, CARV has built CARV Protocol, the modular data layer integrated with 40+ chain ecosystems, and CARV Play, its flagship gaming superapp. CARV has more than 2.5 million registered users and 700 integrated games.

ERC-7231 is “the key to stringing everything together,” said Yu.

Understanding gamers today is increasingly difficult due to app tracking changes (IDFA) and shifting privacy regulations (CCPA). With ERC-7231, users can not only aggregate, own, and control their identities, but gaming and AI companies can leverage this zero- and first-party data to create customized experiences and more accurately target gamers.

For example, according to the company, improved user acquisition was the aim of Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) and its latest game, EA Sports FC Tactical, in Indonesia. Utilizing CARV as one of the primary channels for user acquisition, EA recently recruited Indonesian gamers for the beta test at a lower Cost Per Install (CPI) than traditional channels. Better yet, the game can better understand each gamer and their history thanks to ERC-7231’s aggregated data from multiple gaming accounts.

“Backed by this standard, brands can shift and shape their offering with quality and compliant data, and users can share in the value creation from this information. We welcome all user identity solutions to adopt ERC-7231 and usher in a new age of identity-aggregated NFTs,” said Yu.
About CARV
CARV is the largest modular data layer for gaming and AI, revolutionizing how data is used and shared. CARV ensures privacy, ownership, and control are firmly in the hands of individuals and provides gaming and AI development with holistic and high-quality data reinforced with human feedback in a regulatory-compliant, trustless way. To pioneer a future where data generates value for all, CARV has built CARV Protocol, the modular data layer integrated with 40+ chain ecosystems, and CARV Play, its flagship gaming superapp. CARV has more than 2.5 million registered users and 700 integrated games.

Ethereum-Based Tokenized Real Estate Platform USP Launches On Republic,"Newport Beach, CA, United States of America, March 28th, 2024, Chainwire

How This Californian Startup Is Revolutionizing Real Estate Investment through Ethereum-Based Tokenization

USP, an innovative tokenized real estate investment marketplace and platform, is thrilled to announce its official launch on Republic.com/uspc, a leading crowdfunding portal. This move marks a huge milestone for USP, an incredibly-early tokenized real estate project on the Ethereum network, as well as a major win for investors across the globe seeking to tap into the lucrative world of U.S. real estate investment through cutting-edge blockchain technology.

USP's platform democratizes access to real estate investing, enabling investors of any size and background to participate in the ownership of commercial properties. With an already robust portfolio valued at $52 million and situated throughout Southern California, USP sets a new standard in the tokenized real estate landscape.

Key Highlights of the USP Launch:

Community Strength: USP boasts a vibrant community of over 17.3 thousand active members, underscoring the platform's appeal and reliability as a trusted investment portal.
Tokenized Real Estate Value: Over $52 million worth of real estate is already tokenized on the USP platform, providing a diverse range of investment opportunities for participants.
Accessibility and Ease of Use: The platform is designed to make real estate investment accessible to everyone. With a simple account setup process that takes less than 5 minutes, users can begin buying tokens representing fractional ownership in properties.
What Sets USP Apart:
USP sets itself apart by utilizing the Ethereum blockchain to tokenize properties, enabling global investment without minimum requirements and facilitating peer-to-peer trading.

Through this application of tokenization, USP is essentially democratizing access to traditionally inaccessible real estate assets, making it 100 times easier to become a landlord of real world assets (RWAs).

""Our launch on Republic.com is a leap forward in our mission to simplify real estate investment and make it accessible to the average person,"" said Johnney Zhang, Founder of USP. ""We believe in breaking down barriers to investment, and through our platform, we're not just offering a piece of lucrative U.S. real estate; we're offering a piece of the future.""

DeFi Saver integrates Safe to bring account abstraction to DeFi,"Delaware, USA, March 28th, 2024, Chainwire

In a move to greatly improve the user experience of DeFi users in the Ethereum ecosystem, DeFi Saver integrated native support for Safe smart accounts and multisigs.

DeFi Saver, one of the leading apps for creating, tracking, and managing DeFi positions on Ethereum just announced they’ve integrated account abstraction leader Safe, to take the experience of DeFi users to the next level. This comes on the back of Safe’s recently announced milestone of more than $100 billion in digital assets secured on Safe smart accounts, with more than 40 million transactions conducted on Safe infrastructure.

The update means that DeFi users of protocols such as Aave, Compound, Morpho Blue, Spark, CurveUSD and Liquity will be able to manage their positions more efficiently, through use of options that bundle or batch multiple actions into one single transaction using the power of the Safe smart accounts. This includes features such as leveraging up or unwinding in one transaction, doing collateral and debt swaps, moving whole active positions between different protocols, various automation features, but also even simpler things such as depositing collateral and borrowing funds in one, single transaction. All of this results in unnecessary steps being abstracted away from DeFi users and traders.

Besides all the advanced features that are made possible through use of a smart account, this update also allows DeFi users to greatly increase their security through the use of Safe multisigs, which are the security standard for asset ownership. Starting today, all current and new users can enjoy native multisig support at DeFi Saver moving forward.

Another important aspect for both teams is the composability and portability that users will enjoy. Since Safe is widely supported in DeFi apps and frontends, this means that all DeFi Saver users will be able to check and manage their positions through other apps. And, vice versa, all existing Safe users can now seamlessly connect to the DeFi Saver app and make use of the plethora of tools available.

""We believe that composability and portability are some of the greatest, most important aspects of DeFi and yet this primitive is being ignored by many teams opting to build small, proprietary, walled garden systems. That's why we chose Safe and intend to keep building on the open, permissionless building blocks."" said Nenad Palinkasevic, the co-founder of DeFi Saver.

Lukas Schor, co-founder at Safe, commented, “Smart Accounts are critical infrastructure and we think that for DeFi mass adoption, we need the security of smart accounts, but also the UX benefits to already integrate within the top DeFi projects today. We welcome this move by DeFi Saver to accelerate the transition to smart accounts and Safe ecosystem.”

Moving forward, the teams also highlighted that this change will allow great improvements to the user experience in DeFi through continued batching of multiple actions into single transactions, but also through features such as sign-only modes where all transactions would be handled for the users in the background, providing a quicker and smoother experience.

About DeFi Saver

DeFi Saver is a management application for decentralized finance protocols best known for their advanced leverage management features and automated liquidation protection options. Having initially started as a MakerDAO-focused dapp in the early days of DeFi, they quickly expanded support to more protocols, as well as multiple L2 networks. Today, DeFi Saver lets you utilize protocols such as Aave, Compound, Morpho Blue, Spark, CurveUSD and Liquity, across Ethereum mainnet, Arbitrum, Optimism and Base.

"BlackRock deepens crypto push, debuts first tokenized fund on Ethereum","BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, today launched its first tokenized investment fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). 

Per its official statement, the move signals a major shift towards the integration of blockchain technology into traditional finance. The fund, built on the Ethereum network, aims to provide qualified investors with U.S. dollar yields accessible through Securitize Markets, LLC.

Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets, said the fund focuses on solving client issues in the digital space. “This is the latest progression of our digital assets strategy. We are focused on developing solutions in the digital assets space that help solve real problems for our clients, and we are excited to work with Securitize,” he added.

BUIDL offers a stable token value pegged at $1, distributing dividends directly to investors’ wallets monthly. It focuses on investments in cash, U.S. Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements, ensuring yields for token holders on the blockchain. The fund introduces 24/7 token transfers among pre-approved investors, along with flexible custody options.

Prominent crypto infrastructure providers like Anchorage Digital Bank NA, BitGo, Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN), and Fireblocks are among the first participants supporting BUIDL. BlackRock has chosen Bank of New York Mellon for asset custody and fund management, while Securitize will manage tokenization and fund operations.

Additionally, BlackRock has invested in crypto infrastructure specialist Securitize, appointing Joseph Chalom, Global Head of Strategic Ecosystem Partnerships at BlackRock, to Securitize's Board of Directors. 

The fund’s token shares will be issued under specific U.S. securities regulations, with an initial investment threshold of $5 million. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP will audit the fund operations to ensure compliance with relevant regulations.

“Tokenization of securities could fundamentally transform capital markets. Today’s news demonstrates that traditional financial products are being made more accessible through digitization. Securitize is proud to be BlackRock’s transfer agent, tokenization platform and placement agent of choice in digitizing and expanding access to its investment products,” said Securitize co-founder and CEO Carlos Domingo.

Earlier this month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) postponed its decision on a proposal from BlackRock for a spot ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). This delay marked another hiccup for the asset manager as it aims to launch the iShares Ethereum Trust, which is set to be listed on the Nasdaq should it receive approval."," 03/21/2024, 09:57 AM", 03/21/2024,"3,514.73","3,334.12",-5.1386593,0.016,0.81,0.174,0.9943,"BlackRock deepens crypto push, debuts first tokenized fund on Ethereum BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, today launched its first tokenized investment fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL).

Goldman Sachs says crypto undergoing a 'healthy retracement',"An analysis from Goldman Sachs highlighted a volatile week in the cryptocurrency market, particularly focusing on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). The report notes a 10.4% drop in total market capitalization, amounting to a $280 billion loss. 

The downturn began on a Sunday, with BTC and ETH experiencing three days of declines before recovering during the US trading session, and further strengthening in Asia.

A key observation from Goldman Sachs is the healthy retracement in the cryptocurrency market. This was partly expected due to the rapid ascent to mid-March all-time highs and elevated perpetual futures funding rates, which have since normalized. 

Bitcoin and Ethereum open interest (OI)-weighted funding rates decreased from early March peaks to more sustainable levels, signaling a cooling off from previously overheated market conditions.

“Zooming out, the sudden retracement and follow-up recovery did not come as a surprise, especially if one considers the speed at which we reached the mid March ATH and the elevated perpetual futures funding rates that accompanied it, as investors looked to put on leveraged longs on crypto retail exchanges,” the report reads.

“Since then, the funding rates have settled into healthier levels. BTC OI-weighted funding rate peaked on 5 March at ~107% annualized and has since retreated to ~15% annualized. ETH OI-weighted funding rate peaked on 5 March at ~104% annualized and has similarly pulled back to current ~19% annualized,” it further details.

Investment activities also reflected market sentiment, with Bitcoin ETFs experiencing net outflows over three consecutive days, notably from continued outflows in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) (NYSE:GBTC). However, aside from GBTC, other BTC ETF holdings remained relatively stable, with modest inflows despite the market downturn.

An analysis of BTC holders indicated early signs of profit-taking, as suggested by on-chain activity. There's been a slight decrease in the percentage of BTC supply held for at least one year, indicating increased market activity among medium to longer-term holders. 

Moreover, there's been an uptick in transactional activity, especially within the 7-30 day band, suggesting a higher frequency of BTC changing hands monthly.

Ethereum's performance relative to Bitcoin was also underlined in the research note, with the ETH/BTC ratio dropping. The future of spot ETH ETFs remains uncertain, with regulatory decisions on proposals by Fidelity and Grayscale being delayed.

Ethereum price whipsaws on headlines concerning SEC’s regulatory probe - report,"Ethereum price has made fresh gains today, showing resilience amidst a volatile crypto market. Gains are sustained despite the fact that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has intensified its legal efforts to classify Ethereum as a security, potentially affecting its regulatory status and ETF approvals, according to the report in Fortune.

Ethereum price initially dipped on the headlines regarding regulatory scrutiny before recovering to trade more than 3% on the day.

Elsewhere, Insights from derivatives markets signaled a decrease in open interest on ETH/USDT contracts and a reduction in the funding rate, suggesting possible capitulation by buyers. 

However, caution is advised as Ethereum approaches strong liquidation areas between $3,000 and $2,800, as well as around $4,100.

Recent developments include Glassnode suggesting Bitcoin's correction offers buying opportunities ahead of the April halving, and MicroStrategy strengthening its crypto reserves with a significant BTC acquisition.

Technical analysis on the H4 chart revealed Ethereum's price drop from $4,100 to $3,050 and finding stability around the Fibonacci 50% level, hinting at potential buying opportunities.

Ethereum price is currently hovering just above its 50-day moving average, maintaining a bullish structure, albeit with some revisions in its bullish momentum.

Yet, worries persist about the surge in meme tokens, reminiscent of the ICO frenzy of 2018, as noted by CryptoQuant's founder. Despite institutional support, vigilance and risk management remain crucial to navigate the evolving cryptocurrency terrain.

The crypto market anticipates stabilization following a corrective phase, with Ethereum's performance closely tied to Bitcoin's dynamics amid impending major central bank meetings later in the week.

Crypto market selloff: Don’t miss out on further crypto opportunities,"The cryptocurrency market has been experiencing a selloff over the last few days, causing ripples of concern among investors, with the Bitcoin price now trading around the $64,000 mark.

The recent volatility has led to a flurry of activity, with prices fluctuating and presenting both challenges and potential openings for those keen on capitalizing on the pullback.

Crypto Market Cap: How This Selloff Will Affect It
The sell-off across the various cryptocurrencies will, of course, significantly impact the crypto market cap. Bitcoin’s dominance of the market cap currently stands at over 52%, while ETH takes up 16.3%. Both have experienced share moves lower over the last few days, with Bitcoin down over 10% in the last week and ETH falling over 15% in the last seven days.

The current crypto market cap stands at around $2.43 trillion. However, this week, as cryptos initially moved lower on Wednesday, the market cap dropped as much as 18% from its March highs. That was before the reversals during Wednesday’s session, with both BTC and ETH currently sitting in positive territory.

Despite the shaky week, Bernstein analysts said in a recent note that they believe the crypto market cap can reach $7.5 trillion in 2025.

The firm stated, “We continue to see a cross-cycle 18-month opportunity with Bitcoin and the entire crypto ecosystem.”

Why Is The Crypto Market More Volatile Than Usual?
Jonny Huxtable, CEO of LinkPool, told Investing.com that they ""see a confluence of factors that are currently impacting the price of Bitcoin.”

“The first is that BTC traditionally struggles to reclaim previous cycle all-time-highs and this cycle is no different,” he explained. “It took approximately 3 weeks at the end of 2020 for BTC to go into price discovery and truly clear $20k.”

Huxtable noted that an interesting aspect of this cycle is that Bitcoin has never broken above its .618 cyclical fib on its first attempt.

“We saw this happen in each past cycle where it was swiftly rejected at each .618 tag, but this time was different and came as a shock to many traders and analysts,” Huxtable stated. “This is a testament to the spot BTC ETFs and the asset managers that oversee them.

He also notes that the BTC-to-Gold correlation is at an all-time high, signaling that “we can expect Bitcoin to follow the global markets more closely now that such massive volumes of institutional money are flowing in and out of the ETFs.”

The recent volatility has led to a flurry of activity, with prices fluctuating and presenting both challenges and potential openings for those keen on capitalizing on the pullback.

Crypto Market Cap: How This Selloff Will Affect It
The sell-off across the various cryptocurrencies will, of course, significantly impact the crypto market cap. Bitcoin’s dominance of the market cap currently stands at over 52%, while ETH takes up 16.3%. Both have experienced share moves lower over the last few days, with Bitcoin down over 10% in the last week and ETH falling over 15% in the last seven days.

The current crypto market cap stands at around $2.43 trillion. However, this week, as cryptos initially moved lower on Wednesday, the market cap dropped as much as 18% from its March highs. That was before the reversals during Wednesday’s session, with both BTC and ETH currently sitting in positive territory.

Despite the shaky week, Bernstein analysts said in a recent note that they believe the crypto market cap can reach $7.5 trillion in 2025.

The firm stated, “We continue to see a cross-cycle 18-month opportunity with Bitcoin and the entire crypto ecosystem.”

Why Is The Crypto Market More Volatile Than Usual?
Jonny Huxtable, CEO of LinkPool, told Investing.com that they ""see a confluence of factors that are currently impacting the price of Bitcoin.”

“The first is that BTC traditionally struggles to reclaim previous cycle all-time-highs and this cycle is no different,” he explained. “It took approximately 3 weeks at the end of 2020 for BTC to go into price discovery and truly clear $20k.”

Huxtable noted that an interesting aspect of this cycle is that Bitcoin has never broken above its .618 cyclical fib on its first attempt.

“We saw this happen in each past cycle where it was swiftly rejected at each .618 tag, but this time was different and came as a shock to many traders and analysts,” Huxtable stated. “This is a testament to the spot BTC ETFs and the asset managers that oversee them. If there’s one thing they’re good at doing, it’s diligent profit taking.”

Bernstein says Ethereum and Solana are next as Bitcoin dominates financial markets,"Brokerage firm Bernstein highlighted a positive medium-term outlook for Ethereum, driven by the potential approval of Ethereum-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 

In a recent research report, Bernstein said that Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), stands a big chance of receiving spot ETF approval, becoming the second digital asset to achieve this milestone after Bitcoin.

According to Bernstein, the probability of Ether spot ETF approval by May is about 50%, with a near-certain chance within the next 12 months. This optimistic forecast is buoyed by interest from financial heavyweights like Franklin Templeton, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), and Fidelity, which have already seen Bitcoin ETFs approved and are now applying for Ether counterparts.

Furthermore, Bernstein's report suggests that other leading blockchain ecosystems like Solana, BNB Chain, Avalanche, Aptos, and SUI could collectively fetch a $1.4 trillion valuation. 

Solana, in particular, is expected to lead in developing consumer-driven applications such as stablecoin payments and gaming.

""We expect Solana to lead the charge of fast throughput blockchains, which offer a more optimum design and user experience for more consumer driven applications i.e stablecoin payments and consumer gaming,"" the report reads.

Bernstein analysts also highlighted Ethereum's appeal to mainstream institutional adoption, citing its staking yield dynamics, environmentally friendly design, and the network's capacity to develop new financial markets. The report suggests that the growth of Ether yield markets could lead to fresh ETF designs that incorporate staking yields.

The report further underlines Ethereum's utility beyond merely serving as an asset for ETFs. Institutions are keen on using the Ethereum network to create more transparent and open tokenized financial markets, indicating the broad use cases the coin offers beyond asset gathering.

Ethereum's newest Dencun upgrade was highlighted for its success in reducing transaction costs by 50%-90. Bernstein projects the Ethereum ecosystem to reach a valuation of $1.8 trillion, including the Ethereum network, staking infrastructure, layer 2 chains, and Ethereum-based DeFi apps.

According to analysts at Bernstein, Bitcoin's recent $10,000 retreat from all-time highs of over $73,000 to around $63,000 presents a dip buying opportunity ahead of the upcoming halving in April.

In a note to clients, Bernstein described the current phase of consolidation in Bitcoin as temporary, which offers a chance for traders to reposition their risk before the halving event. The analysts maintain a bullish outlook on Bitcoin and the entire crypto ecosystem, viewing the next 18 months as an opportunity for growth.

Bernstein previously argued that public miner stocks are the best equity proxy to Bitcoin's price trajectory, especially as it heads towards their 2024-2025 cycle target.

$7.5 trillion crypto market cap? Bernstein says this is what needs to happen,"Bernstein, a prominent financial research firm, has outlined a trajectory for the Bitcoin price and cryptocurrency market that it believes could lead to a $7.5 trillion market capitalization.

The projection highlights the firm's bullish outlook on Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market’s future, even as a few are currently pulling back from their recent highs. 

Bitcoin price corrects
Bitcoin price is down more than 6% Tuesday, trading above the $63,000 mark after hitting new highs of more than $73,000 last week. The slide took hold over the weekend. 

However, the selling was not limited to Bitcoin as other cryptocurrencies have experienced a decline while US equity futures are down. Ethereum has fallen more than 7%.

The more than 6% fall in BTC has put it on track for its largest one-day fall in two weeks.

Even so, the premier cryptocurrency is up around 50% so far in 2024 and more than 125% in the last 12 months. With Bitcoin surging to new highs last week, profit-taking has occurred, while talk regarding the US Federal Reserve potentially not cutting rates this year has also impacted the price. 

How crypto market cap can reach $7.5 trillion
Despite the more recent fall, analysts at Bernstein believe the current phase of Bitcoin consolidation is temporary and offers a dip buying opportunity prior to Bitcoin halving.

“We continue to see a cross-cycle 18-month opportunity with Bitcoin and the entire crypto ecosystem,” declared Bernstein.”Overall, Bitcoin is seeing correction ahead of the halving (down ~10% last 7 days). ETF flows are reflexive - higher on the way up and slower with weaker price action.” 

“Yesterday, Bitcoin ETFs clocked a net outflow of $154mn, the first outflow day since March 1,” they added. “Historically, Bitcoin price action has consolidated ahead of the halving, and considering Bitcoin rallied hard prior to ETFs and post the ETFs launch with record inflows, the correction seems healthy and does not affect our cross-cycle view, i.e that Bitcoin is headed to $150K as the cycle high by 2025.” 

Bernstein sees the market consolidating prior to halving (April 20, 20224) and then expects the overall bull markets to continue.

Looking further ahead, they see the 2025 crypto market cap opportunity at $7.5 trillion, with Bitcoin’s market cap leading the charge, rising to $3 trillion. 

The firm explained it expects the growth of Bitcoin with ETFs continuing to drive adoption within asset portfolios across RIAs, private banks, and wirehouses, while it also sees the Bitcoin ETF industry assets under management (AUM) growing from $60 billion today to $300 billion by the end of the cycle in 2025. 

“We expect Bitcoin halving and weak circulating float on exchanges to keep Bitcoin supply constrained relative to the strong demand by ETFs,” added Bernstein. 

Meanwhile, it sees the Ethereum ecosystem hitting a $1.8 trillion market cap. The Ethereum ecosystem consists of the Ethereum network, ETH staking infrastructure, Ethereum layer 2 chains, and Ethereum-based DeFi infrastructure. 

“We expect SEC to approve the ETH ETF over the next 12 months,” stated Bernstein. “We stack the chances of ETH ETF approval by April/August 2024 at 50%. Ethereum is the only other digital asset likely to get an approved ETF this cycle>

Finally, other leading Blockchain ecosystems, such as Solana, BNB chain, Avalanche, Aptos, and SUI, are expected to reach $1.4 trillion.

Banking Consortium R3 Leads $9M Round in Encrypted Layer 2 on Ethereum,"London, UK, March 15th, 2024, Chainwire

TEN, an encrypted Ethereum Layer 2 network, announces a funding round of $9 million USD, led by digital powerhouse R3. Obscuro Labs’ TEN is an Ethereum Layer 2 roll-up platform addressing critical encryption and scaling issues in blockchain applications. R3, a consortium of 42 of the world’s largest banks exploring blockchain-based RWA tokenization and CBDC, has been a major supporter of TEN from its inception.

Over half of TEN’s senior team hails from R3, which developed the leading tokenization platform Corda, bringing significant experience to the table. In addition to R3, the funding round includes support from notable investors such as Republic Crypto, KuCoin Labs, Big Brain Capital, DWF Labs, and Magnus Capital.

TEN strikes a balance between Optimistic-based L2s and ZK-Rollups, offering speed, security, versatility and privacy not currently available in existing Layer 2 solutions. The platform, currently in testnet, is set to release on the mainnet in October, boasting features like programmable encryption, immediate bridges, and secure random number generation.

TEN distinguishes itself as a general-purpose L2 on Ethereum, aiming to provide efficiency akin to Optimistic-based L2s while maintaining full encryption. The platform addresses encryption, MEV prevention, scalability, and gas efficiency, positioning itself as a unique addition to the Web3 landscape.

In order to maximize safety for its users, the platform takes advantage of the proven security that Ethereum offers, while focusing on adding value with a number of key features like encryption. TEN allows developers to choose which parts of the smart contract they want private and which parts public. This massively opens up the design space, allowing a whole new generation of on-chain games, DeFi, RWA, and institutional use cases to be developed. All this is done while vastly improving scalability.

As an L2, the speed and cost are both very efficient, providing near-immediate finality and making TEN the fastest encrypted network in Web3. The responsiveness is so fast that it behaves like a Web2 application. The platform was designed such that development teams can build their dApps using just Solidity and Ethereum-based tools. Building on TEN is identical to building on Ethereum. For users, adding TEN’s secure functionality takes just three clicks, and users don't even know they're using an encrypted dApp. The experience is entirely seamless.

Gavin Thomas, Co-Founder and CEO of Obscuro Labs, Comments: ""Layer 2s were always not just about scaling, but enhancing Ethereum with new features in ways that cannot be done on Mainnet. With TEN, we deliver on that promise by bringing everything we learnt from building encryption on Corda to Ethereum.""

TEN, with over 120 partners, leverages the team's expertise to address key issues in the Ethereum ecosystem. The platform's name, ""TEN,"" symbolizes its role as ""The Encrypted Network"" and its position as a Layer 2 network.

With ongoing testing on Coinlist's testnet and plans for a mainnet launch in October, TEN is poised to establish itself as a leading Layer 2 in Web3. The platform's focus on encryption, privacy, and efficiency sets the stage for its role in shaping the future of decentralized technologies.

About TEN

TEN is a pure EVM encrypted L2 solution for Ethereum, positioned between Optimistic and ZK rollups. With a strong team and backing from R3, TEN aims to offer secure, efficient, and decentralized solutions for Web3 applications.

Ethereum, a key peer to Bitcoin, has been boosted by hopes that it too may soon have ETFs following its price. It had risen by 3.9% to $3,520.90 on Monday, hovering around two-year highs notched last week.",769.53,1480.0,2249.53,92.3251855
Hong Kong's largest bitcoin ETF assets up five-fold since October,"By Summer Zhen

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's largest bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund saw its assets under management swell five-fold in the past five months to just over $100 million, as local investors chased the rally in the world's best-known cryptocurrency.

Hong Kong has been a relative latecomer to crypto trading, approving its first three cryptocurrency futures ETFs in late 2022.

CSOP Asset Management, which manages the CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF, said demand grew substantially in February.

The approval and launch of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. this year has spurred demand from investors who believe the token's limited supply will push prices higher, said Alessandro Zhu, who oversees crypto products and is deputy head of fixed income at CSOP Asset Management.

Bitcoin's significant outperformance of Hong Kong stocks has also boosted demand, he added.

Zhu noted that although cryptocurrency trading is banned in mainland China, offshore Chinese financial institutions could invest in bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong.

Bitcoin has gained 45% this month alone and, trading around $63,000 on Thursday, is closing in on its November 2021 record highs near $69,000.

Assets under management for CSOP Ether Futures ETF have also benefited, doubling this year.

Volumes have surged.

Average daily turnover for the CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF this year has jumped to $2.8 million compared to $0.97 million last year, now at par with turnover in some Hong Kong property giants such as the Wharf (Holdings).

Some market participants expect Hong Kong to approve the first spot bitcoin ETF this year as officials are keen to develop the city as a hub for virtual assets.

Peter Thiel's VC firm injected $200 million in bitcoin and ether before bull run,"According to Reuters, Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund has made a new investment in bitcoin and ether before the beginning of the ongoing crypto bull run.

The investment was equally divided between the top two cryptocurrencies by market cap.

The move, which had not been disclosed before, highlights a renewed engagement from some institutional investors in the cryptocurrency market, which faced challenges in 2022 due to the downfall of major entities like the crypto exchange FTX, leading to a decrease in valuations, damage to the sector's reputation, and increased regulatory scrutiny.

Exclusive-Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund made $200 million crypto investment before bull run,"By Anna Tong and Krystal Hu

(Reuters) - Founders Fund, the venture capital firm founded by billionaire Peter Thiel, is investing once again in bitcoin and ether, sources said, signaling Silicon Valley's renewed interest in cryptocurrency markets.

From late summer to early fall last year, the fund invested $200 million to acquire crypto tokens, half in bitcoin and the other half in ether, the two largest cryptocurrencies, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

The previously unreported move by the prominent Silicon Valley venture capital firm underscores some institutional investors' return to token investments, once the hottest investment strategy before the crypto market crashed in 2022.

The outsized bet marks a comeback for crypto markets, which suffered in 2022 after the collapse of crypto exchange FTX and other big players crushed prices, tarnished the industry and prompted a regulatory crackdown.

In 2022, the price of bitcoin crashed to nearly $15,000, its lowest price since 2020.

Bitcoin and ether prices have gradually climbed over the past year, with bitcoin hitting $50,000 for first time in more than two years this week, but still below its peak of $69,000 in November 2021.

As one of the earliest institutional investors in crypto, Founders Fund began aggressively buying bitcoin in 2014, but then liquidated it before the crypto market crashed in 2022, making about $1.8 billion in returns.

Last summer, Founder's Fund started to acquire bitcoin when it was below $30,000, and purchased more bitcoin and ether over a few months, sources added. Reuters wasn't able to learn the average price of those purchases.

A spokesperson for the fund declined to comment.

Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Palantir (NYSE:PLTR), has publicly praised bitcoin, a currency based on blockchain technology that exists outside the purview of central banks, saying it is a store of value like gold and a hedge against central banks' monetary policy.

The cryptocurrency affinity aligns with the billionaire's interests in libertarianism, small government and technology innovation.

Ethereum (ETH) Becomes Target of Massive $1 Billion Sell-Off: Who's Responsible?,"U.Today - Ethereum is encountering a massive sell-off exceeding $1 billion. The source of this enormous market movement can be traced back to Celsius, which reportedly transferred a staggering 459,561 ETH, valued at approximately $1.014 billion, to various exchanges.

The distribution of this sell-off was as follows: 297,454 ETH ($656.5 million) moved to Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) Prime, 146,507 ETH to Paxos Treasury and smaller amounts of 7,800 ETH each, totaling $17.2 million, were transferred to FalconX and Coinbase. Despite this massive transfer, Celsius reportedly retains a reserve of 62,468 ETH, worth around $139 million.

Such a colossal sale exerts immense pressure on Ethereum's price and could significantly sway market sentiment. The immediate concern for investors and traders is whether Ethereum's liquidity and market capitalization can absorb such a hit without triggering a broad market downturn.

From a technical analysis standpoint, the massive outflow from Celsius is a bearish signal, likely to test Ethereum's local support levels. A crucial support to watch is around the $2,000 price range, a psychological and technical support level, which, if breached, could see the price tumble to the next significant support at $1,800. This level has historically acted as a strong buy zone and may serve as a robust defense against further declines.

Conversely, resistance levels have become more formidable due to the sell-off. Any potential recovery will have to confront the resistance at $2,200, which previously acted as a support level. A break above this could see Ethereum attempt to reclaim higher price levels, possibly testing the $2,400 resistance.

The substantial sell-off initiated by Celsius has placed Ethereum in a problematic position. Although the Ethereum network's fundamentals remain robust, the asset's price resilience in the face of such a significant sell-off shows the actual state of the market.

$13 Milion in Ethereum (ETH) Destroyed as Supply Becomes Deflationary Again,"U.Today - The recent data from Ethereum network indicates that the supply of Ethereum has once again entered a deflationary phase. Over the past 30 days, a striking $13 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) has been destroyed, with the net supply change showing a decrease of 5,619.39 ETH. This deflationary pressure is due to the network's burning mechanism, which has incinerated 74,933.24 ETH, outstripping the 69,313.86 ETH issued in the same period.

The implications of this deflationary trend could signal an approaching rally for Ethereum. A deflationary supply inherently suggests that the available quantity of ETH is decreasing, which could lead to an increase in value per token, assuming demand stays the same or grows. This dynamic, combined with the Ethereum network's continuous development and adoption, may set the stage for a bullish scenario.

ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewAnalyzing the Ethereum chart, a crucial factor is the potential breakthrough of the 50-day Exponential Moving Average. Currently, Ethereum hovers just below this significant level, and a break above could confirm a shift in market sentiment, potentially igniting upward price movement.

However, it is essential to acknowledge that Ethereum's current market traction is relatively muted. Despite the burn and the deflationary state of supply, the lack of significant network activity or groundbreaking updates has kept the token from gaining substantial momentum. Even activities by Ethereum's cofounder, Vitalik Buterin, which have historically influenced the market, seem to provide only a moderate push at best, under current conditions.

The market awaits a catalyst that could reignite Ethereum's dominance in the blockchain space. While the reduction in supply is a positive sign, without an accompanying increase in demand or network utility, the impact on price may be limited.

Ethereum Closer to Epic Rebranding as Sepolia Welcomes Dencun Upgrade,"U.Today - The Ethereum blockchain is on its way to a massive rebranding as its long-awaited Dencun upgrade is now live on the Sepolia testnet. The Ethereum Foundation projected that the Dencun upgrade would launch on Sepolia by Jan. 30, and the successful integration was revealed by core developer Terrence.eth, for which he received many accolades from the community.

The Dencun upgrade going live on Sepolia is one of the two remaining steps required to launch the update on the Ethereum mainnet. Ethereum has long been plagued with lower scalability and high gas fees. For this, it has continued to receive intense backlash from industry analysts like legendary trader Peter Brandt, who considers its high cost of operation a basis for its demise in the long term.

The Dencun upgrade will attempt to resolve scalability issues while also making Ethereum more cost-effective as a protocol. The Dencun upgrade will specifically introduce proto-danksharding, a compressed data storage mechanism dubbed ""blobs"" to help optimize performance.

Development efforts are now in their advanced stages as the upgrade was launched on the Goerli testnet earlier this month. The last step before the mainnet debut will be to launch on the Holesky testnet, an upgrade that is scheduled for Feb. 7.

Ethereum to fight back against its competitors
Many new protocols have emerged to capitalize on the weakness of the Ethereum protocol. From Solana (SOL) to Cardano (ADA) and even Avalanche (AVAX), the race to dethrone Ethereum remains the core mantra for many developers in the Web3 ecosystem today.
With the Dencun upgrade, many of the pain points on Ethereum can be resolved, thus making the protocol more attractive to developers and end users overall. With the upgrade, Ethereum is poised to extend its dominance as the top blockchain of choice for all things decentralized finance (DeFi) and more.

Major FED Decision to Affect Crypto Market in Two Days,"U.Today - The crypto market is bracing itself as the Federal Reserve gears up to announce its first interest rate decision of 2024. The whispers from the CME about a 96.9% chance to keep interest rates unchanged are causing ripples. Yet, with the second decision in March casting a 47% shadow of a rate cut by 25 basis points (bps), investors are on edge. Adding to the economic fervor, the United States is set to release the January unemployment rate, which could further sway market sentiment.

The Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates is a critical economic lever that traditionally influences traditional markets and, as has been seen, the cryptocurrency market as well. An unchanged interest rate could maintain the status quo, possibly keeping investment steady in assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

A cut, however, could signal economic caution, potentially reducing the attractiveness of risk assets like cryptocurrencies or, conversely, could lead investors to seek higher returns in the crypto market if traditional investments falter.

BTC/USD Chart by TradingViewAnalyzing the Bitcoin chart, there is a distinctive ""war"" between the bulls and bears. The immediate resistance level to watch is around the $42,500 mark, which Bitcoin has been testing recently. This level is crucial because a decisive close above it could signal increasing bullish momentum. On the downside, the support level at approximately $39,528, aligning with a psychological round number and a previous area of interest, is one that traders are likely to defend vigorously.

The upcoming Fed decision could serve as a catalyst for Bitcoin's next big move. If interest rates remain unchanged, Bitcoin could continue to test the resistance level, and a break above could confirm a bullish reversal. However, should rates decrease, Bitcoin's reaction might be even more unpredictable.

"Shiba Inu (SHIB) Rapidly Breaks Down, Ethereum (ETH) Loses Traction, While Solana (SOL) Presents Hidden Opportunity","U.Today - Shiba Inu has experienced a significant breakdown from its recent consolidation phase. The chart depicts a clear downward trajectory as SHIB failed to maintain its position within the ascending triangle pattern it had formed over the past few months.

The breakdown was signaled as SHIB prices breached the key support level at $0.000009, which had previously acted as a reliable floor for the price during consolidation phases. Following this, SHIB prices tumbled further, slicing through subsequent support near $0.0000087. This price action marked a decisive shift in market sentiment from accumulation to distribution.

SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewThe next support level to watch is at $0.0000082, where SHIB may find a temporary reprieve from the selling pressure. If this level fails to hold, the next critical support lies at $0.0000076, which could serve as the last line of defense before a more significant drop.

For a reversal to occur and for SHIB to regain its upward momentum, it would need to reclaim previous support levels and transform them back into supports. This would require a substantial influx of buying pressure, potentially sparked by positive developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem or broader cryptocurrency market rallies.

The first sign of a possible reversal would be a return above $0.0000087, followed by a sustained move above the $0.000009 price level. A breakout above these levels, accompanied by increasing volume, could indicate that the downtrend is losing steam and that bulls are regaining control.

Solana paints reversal pattern
Solana has been developing a subtle yet potentially pivotal chart pattern. The asset has been tracing a slow and steady ascending channel, a formation that suggests a controlled and consistent uptrend. This pattern, characterized by higher lows and higher highs contained within two parallel trendlines, speaks to potential for continued growth.
The significance of this pattern lies in the momentum it could provide for SOL. Should the price action remain strong within the upper half of the channel, and particularly if it challenges the upper trendline, we could see Solana break through and embark on a more aggressive rally.

Such a bullish scenario would likely be supported by increased trading volume and positive developments within the Solana ecosystem, such as new project launches or updates that enhance network performance.

The immediate local resistance stands at around $55, and a confident push beyond this could confirm bullish sentiment. Inversely, if Solana's price dips below the channel's lower boundary, around $48, it could indicate that a bearish narrative is taking hold.

Ethereum momentum decreasing
Ethereum is exhibiting signs of waning momentum, as observed in recent price movements. The asset, which has long been considered the backbone of the decentralized finance sector, is facing a pivotal moment that could determine its trajectory for the coming weeks.
The provided chart illustrates Ethereum's struggle to maintain its grasp on the market. The price has been on a downward trend, edging closer to the local 26-day Exponential Moving Average. This level, currently near $2,465, is critical; if Ethereum fails to hold this line, we might see it descend to test the more significant 50 EMA, which stands around the $2,300 mark.

The 26 EMA serves as a short-term sentiment gauge, and its breach could signal a lack of immediate bullish support. Should this level fail to act as a springboard for price recovery, Ethereum's next stop could indeed be the 50 EMA. A breach below this longer-term moving average could potentially open the gates for a test of lower support levels, highlighting the need for investors to brace for more volatility.

Market participants are now recalibrating their expectations, understanding that the road to sustainable gains is a long-term journey.

If this level fails to hold, the next critical support lies at $0.0000076, which could serve as the last line of defense before a more significant drop.

For a reversal to occur and for SHIB to regain its upward momentum, it would need to reclaim previous support levels and transform them back into supports. This would require a substantial influx of buying pressure, potentially sparked by positive developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem or broader cryptocurrency market rallies.

The first sign of a possible reversal would be a return above $0.0000087, followed by a sustained move above the $0.000009 price level. A breakout above these levels, accompanied by increasing volume, could indicate that the downtrend is losing steam and that bulls are regaining control.

Solana paints reversal pattern
Solana has been developing a subtle yet potentially pivotal chart pattern. The asset has been tracing a slow and steady ascending channel, a formation that suggests a controlled and consistent uptrend. This pattern, characterized by higher lows and higher highs contained within two parallel trendlines, speaks to potential for continued growth.
The significance of this pattern lies in the momentum it could provide for SOL. Should the price action remain strong within the upper half of the channel, and particularly if it challenges the upper trendline, we could see Solana break through and embark on a more aggressive rally.

Such a bullish scenario would likely be supported by increased trading volume and positive developments within the Solana ecosystem, such as new project launches or updates that enhance network performance.

The immediate local resistance stands at around $55, and a confident push beyond this could confirm bullish sentiment. Inversely, if Solana's price dips below the channel's lower boundary, around $48, it could indicate that a bearish narrative is taking hold.

Ethereum momentum decreasing
Ethereum is exhibiting signs of waning momentum, as observed in recent price movements. The asset, which has long been considered the backbone of the decentralized finance sector, is facing a pivotal moment that could determine its trajectory for the coming weeks.
The provided chart illustrates Ethereum's struggle to maintain its grasp on the market. The price has been on a downward trend, edging closer to the local 26-day Exponential Moving Average. This level, currently near $2,465, is critical; if Ethereum fails to hold this line, we might see it descend to test the more significant 50 EMA, which stands around the $2,300 mark.

The 26 EMA serves as a short-term sentiment gauge, and its breach could signal a lack of immediate bullish support. Should this level fail to act as a springboard for price recovery, Ethereum's next stop could indeed be the 50 EMA. A breach below this longer-term moving average could potentially open the gates for a test of lower support levels, highlighting the need for investors to brace for more volatility.

Market participants are now recalibrating their expectations, understanding that the road to sustainable gains is a long-term journey.

Another Dormant Ethereum Whale With Pre-Mined ETH Suddenly Wakes Up,"U.Today - In a remarkable development within the cryptocurrency sphere, an inactive Ethereum whale, dormant for eight and a half years, has reemerged into the scene by transferring a significant 100 ETH, translating to a substantial $230,159. Etherscan data reveals that this address, dormant since its genesis block in July 2015, has stirred curiosity as it displays activity for the first time.

The awakening saw the whale execute transfers, sending 20 ETH to one undisclosed address and 77 ETH to another, both shrouded in mystery. This resurgence aligns with a recent trend, as another dormant Ethereum address, containing 492 ETH valued at $1.14 million, was activated after a prolonged dormancy since its genesis event, as reported by U.Today last Friday.

Influence on Ethereum price
The sudden activation of these major players in the crypto market prompts speculation about potential ramifications for Ethereum's price. Historical data indicates that similar instances, where substantial volumes were moved by large holders of cryptocurrencies, often triggered market volatility.
ETH to USD by CoinMarketCapDespite a double-digit drop in Ethereum's value following the last awakening of such whales in late May, the cryptocurrency managed to bounce back. Analysts now caution against underestimating the potential risks associated with these dormant whales.

If more such entities resurface, market participants are advised to heed historical patterns and exercise prudence to avoid overestimating potential risks.

The crypto community remains on high alert, closely monitoring the actions of these dormant giants, as their reentry into the market could hold implications for the altcoin's stability.

"XRP's Epic Battle Against Bears, Solana Breaks $100, While Ethereum Fights for Momentum","U.Today - XRP is currently locked in a fierce struggle with bearish forces. The digital asset, which operates within the Ripple network, is experiencing difficulty establishing a position above a critical technical indicator — the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).

The 200 EMA serves as an important barometer for the long-term trend and investor sentiment. For XRP, remaining below this level suggests that the asset lacks the bullish momentum needed to shift into an upward trajectory. This inability to secure a foothold above the 200 EMA raises questions about the stability of positive price action in the near term.

XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewTechnical analysis shows that the 200 EMA is a dynamic level of resistance that many traders watch closely. A consistent failure to breach this mark can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy where the resistance level grows stronger, as more traders set their sell orders around this key price point.

Ethereum keeps on struggling
Ethereum is showing signs of losing its upward momentum, failing to form a higher high — an indicator that market experts often interpret as a sign of an impending price correction.
The ETH chart reveals a telling pattern; the absence of a new higher high is significant. Typically, in a bullish market phase, the price of an asset creates a series of higher highs and higher lows. However, Ethereum's inability to push beyond its recent peak may suggest that the bulls are running out of steam and a reevaluation of market sentiment could be underway.

Analyzing the chart, the local resistance level has been a tough ceiling for Ethereum to break. This resistance, where sell orders tend to cluster, is acting as a barrier preventing further upward movement. On the flip side, the support level represents a price point with a concentration of buy orders, offering a potential cushion against a price drop. If Ethereum fails to uphold the support level, it could trigger a price breakdown, signaling a shift to a bearish trend.

If Ethereum's price continues to struggle, the scenario could unfold where the asset drops further, testing subsequent support levels. While the underlying fundamentals of Ethereum, such as network upgrades and adoption rates, remain robust, the short-term price action could still be subject to corrective forces.

Solana wants another round
The battleground of volatility on the crypto market continues, and Solana (SOL) has not been spared from its whims. Once a darling of the crypto world for its speed and efficiency, SOL has recently been up against a wall, struggling to surpass the crucial $100 mark. The price chart reflects a narrative of struggle and resistance, painting a picture of an asset in need of momentum.
The technical outlook for SOL is looking promising. After a period of bullish activity that piqued the interest of many investors, SOL has hit a snag near the $100 resistance level. This resistance level represents a significant psychological and financial barrier, as it is where sell orders tend to accumulate, putting downward pressure on the price.

Despite efforts to rally, the asset has been unable to generate the necessary momentum to overcome this threshold with ease and currently consolidates at it. One of the key factors influencing this lackluster performance could be the market's tepid reaction to the announcement of Solana phone Saga 2. The news, which might have been expected to inject some enthusiasm onto the market, failed to provide substantial support for Solana's price.

Looking at the chart, the local support levels are clearly delineated. The first line of defense for SOL lies around the $88-$90 price range, where previous dips have found buyers waiting. Should this level fail to hold, the next support may not emerge until it reaches the more robust $70 level, which could act as a stronger foothold for the price.

Conversely, resistance beyond $100 is now more formidable than ever. With each rejection, the resolve of buyers weakens, and the $100 level transforms from a mere price point into a crucial psychological level you should not miss.

"Ethereum (ETH) Loses All of Its Gains, Bitcoin (BTC) Not Ready to Give up $40,000, Solana (SOL) Comeback Starts","U.Today - Ethereum has wiped out the gains it had accumulated over a sustained period. The ETH/USD price chart depicts a grim narrative as the digital asset has swiftly descended from its peak, retracing back to levels that question the sustainability of its prior growth.

The steep decline in Ethereum's price is a significant bearish signal. It reflects the market's hesitancy to invest at previous highs, most likely due to the underperformance Ethereum has shown in the recent past. This lack of traction and inability to initiate a recovery underscores the vulnerability of Ethereum's price in the current market climate.

ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewFocusing on the technical aspects, Ethereum has broken through what was once seen as a strong support level at approximately $2,350. This price point, which previously saw substantial buying interest, has now been breached, leading to a cascading effect as the asset searches for new support. The next critical support level is around $2,175, where buyers might emerge to stall the downfall.

Conversely, any attempts at recovery will first encounter resistance at around $2,338, a level that now marks the lower boundary of what was a consolidation range before the drop. A close above this level on significant volume could signal a temporary respite from selling pressure. However, the real test lies at higher resistance levels, previously established around $2,500, where ETH struggled to maintain upward momentum.

Bitcoin ready to fight
Recent candlestick formations portray a scenario where Bitcoin is flirting with a critical resistance level, poised to either confirm a bearish trend or start a substantial recovery.
The chart illustrates Bitcoin’s recent descent, as it lost its foothold at the higher price echelons it previously occupied. However, amid this downward movement, Bitcoin is showing signs of resilience. The latest candles indicate a potential reversal as they hover around a significant support level, which can be identified at approximately $37,000, a region where buyers have historically stepped in.

A sustained hold above this point could catalyze renewed buying interest, which may drive the price toward the immediate resistance level at around $41,000. The significance of reclaiming this threshold cannot be understated, as it may invalidate the bearish outlook and signal a trend reversal.

As for the upper resistances, the $43,000 and $46,000 price levels stand out as notable barriers that Bitcoin would need to breach to cement a robust recovery narrative. Achieving such milestones could sway market sentiment positively, potentially ushering in a wave of optimism among investors.

The moving averages offer additional insight, suggesting a possible bullish crossover should the current momentum persist. This scenario would be further supported by a rise in trading volume, which typically accompanies decisive trend shifts.

Solana among leaders
Solana shows signs of a nascent comeback, presenting a bullish scenario amid a broader market recovery. However, investors tread cautiously, aware of the potential of a ""dead cat bounce"" since volume profiles signal restraint.
Analyzing the SOL/USDT chart, we notice that Solana has established a local support level around the $70 price mark. This is characterized by multiple touches of this level over the past few weeks, each time resisting further downward movement.

On the flip side, the local resistance can be identified near the $96 level, which previously acted as support during Solana's consistent upward trend.

The price movement is currently sandwiched between the 50-day moving average acting as dynamic resistance and the 200-day moving average serving as potential dynamic support. The narrowing gap between these averages could squeeze the price action, possibly leading to a volatility breakout.

"XRP Starts Moving Earlier, Solana (SOL) Already Stronger Than Everyone Else; Does Ethereum (ETH) Need More Fuel?","U.Today - XRP appears to have begun its market movements earlier than anticipated. The chart shows a notable shift from the recent sideways trading pattern, as XRP starts to carve out a new direction.

As of the latest trends, XRP has been testing the support level around $0.50, a crucial psychological threshold for the asset. A sustained move below this level could signal further bearish momentum, potentially leading the price to test the next significant support zone around $0.47.

XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewOn the flip side, if XRP manages to stabilize and bounce back from the current support, the initial resistance is likely to be encountered near the $0.54 mark, where the 50-day moving average currently lies. This moving average has historically acted as a dynamic resistance level, and a breakout above could propel XRP toward the $0.56 level, which aligns with the 100-day moving average.

Further complicating the chart is the downward trendline that has been in play since the local high established in November. This trendline has repeatedly acted as resistance, pushing the price downward each time it has been tested. For a true reversal to be confirmed, XRP would need to break above this trendline with significant volume to validate the move.

Solana is leading pack
Solana is manifesting its strength as the top performer among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Despite overall market volatility, SOL's price action has been signaling a stronger recovery compared to other assets.
At the time of analysis, Solana is trading around the $90 mark, having rebounded with considerable momentum from the support level near $78.35. This pivotal point, bolstered by the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), has served as a springboard for the recent bullish trend. The price of SOL has been consistently creating higher lows, indicative of strong buying interest at these levels.

Resistance for SOL is currently looming at the $100 psychological level, a breakthrough of which could propel the price toward the next significant resistance at $110.

The relative strength of Solana is further substantiated by the resurgence of a risk appetite on the market, particularly evidenced by the blossoming of meme coins. This renewed interest in higher-risk assets typically bodes well for ecosystems like Solana that support a variety of decentralized applications and niche crypto projects.

Ethereum needs push
The Ethereum market is currently facing a confluence of challenges as it searches for the momentum to sustain its position. A recent chart analysis reveals an indecisive atmosphere among investors, with Ethereum struggling to find a strong directional move.
At present, Ethereum is hovering around the $2,200 mark, a level that has seen significant activity and is currently acting as a temporary support. However, the lack of bullish conviction suggests that this support level may not hold if a new wave of selling pressure emerges.

Resistance levels are observed near the $2,400 range, where previous attempts to break higher have been met with a firm rejection, indicating a substantial barrier to upward movement.

The selling pressure is partly attributed to the recent news of Celsius Network liquidating approximately $1 billion worth of Ethereum holdings. This substantial amount has the potential to saturate the market, overwhelming current liquidity and triggering a downturn. As a result, the $2,000 psychological level is eyed as the next critical support zone, a breach of which could see a sharp decline toward the $1,950 region, where the 200-day moving average lies, providing stronger historical support.

On the flip side, if Ethereum can absorb the selling pressure and gain the necessary ""fuel,"" a push above the $2,400 resistance could open the path toward the $2,500 area before challenging the more formidable resistance at $2,600, which aligns with the 50-day moving average.

"Dogecoin (DOGE) Breakout Occurs, What's Next? Solana (SOL) Stays Dominant, Will Ethereum (ETH) Survive Unseen Stalemate?","U.Today - Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency that started as a joke but became a favorite of the masses, including Elon Musk, has recently experienced a significant breakout.

After a period of consolidation, DOGE has broken past a critical resistance level, stirring excitement among traders and investors. The coin is currently sitting above the $0.088 mark, which previously acted as substantial resistance. If DOGE manages to maintain its position above this level, it could solidify this area as new support.

Dogecoin/USDT Chart by TradingViewA break above the $0.095 resistance could signal a continued bullish trend, potentially leading Dogecoin to test the psychological barrier of $0.10. If the momentum is sustained and market sentiment remains positive, DOGE could attempt to reach higher highs, possibly moving toward the $0.105 to $0.11 range last seen during its peak periods of trading activity.

Immediate support for DOGE is now at $0.088 which, if held, could act as a springboard for further climbs. However, should Dogecoin fail to maintain this level, it might fall back to its previous support near $0.078, where buyers have historically shown interest.

A scenario where DOGE's breakout continues would likely involve increased adoption news or a resurgence of interest in meme coins, potentially sparked by social media or celebrity endorsements. Such catalysts could drive demand and push DOGE past the $0.095 level, cementing its breakout status.

Conversely, if the breakout fails to sustain, perhaps due to broader market bearishness or fading interest, DOGE could slide back below $0.088. This would retest the resilience of the $0.078 support. A drop below this level could lead to a bearish phase, with DOGE potentially seeking lower ground.

Solana shows strength
During this market cycle, Solana has established itself as a leader. With its stable and easily scalable performance, it outpaces giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as the majority of DeFi volume went to the ""Ethereum killer.""
As the DeFi ecosystem on Solana flourishes, it is becoming a hub for innovation, blending meme culture with decentralized applications. The network's efficiency and scalability are attracting a wide array of developers.

The cryptocurrency that has been on a strong upward trajectory. Currently, Solana is testing a resistance level at approximately $100, a significant psychological and technical barrier. A convincing break above this level could signal continued bullish momentum, potentially leading to testing the next resistance zone around $108, which coincides with recent highs.

On the downside, the 50-day moving average, sitting near $93.23, is providing dynamic support. This level has been defended multiple times, indicating its importance to traders. If Solana can maintain its footing above this moving average, it would reinforce the asset's stability and could serve as a springboard for further gains.

The next crucial test for Solana will be sustaining above $100. Should it consolidate above this level, it would not be unrealistic to envision a push toward $108, or even higher, as the market reassesses Solana's value proposition in the context of a rapidly evolving DeFi and NFT landscape.

Fundamental Ethereum problems
As it struggles to gain momentum, Ethereum's scalability suffering and the diminishing traction of meme coins on its network are at the forefront of the bearish case for the second-biggest cryptocurrency on the market.
The network's inability to handle high transaction volumes without exorbitant fees has led to the sentiment that Ethereum is becoming ""unusable"" for the day-to-day transactions that meme coins require.

From a technical standpoint, Ethereum's price analysis paints a picture of uncertainty. The asset has been struggling to maintain momentum above crucial support levels. Currently, Ethereum is wavering around the $2,250 mark, with immediate support near the $2,150 level. A break below this support could see a decline toward the $2,000 psychological barrier, which would represent a significant bearish development.

Layer-2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum have emerged as potential stopgaps, offering faster and cheaper transactions. However, their adoption has been less than stellar, with many viewing these platforms as temporary fixes rather than a comprehensive solution to Ethereum's underlying scalability problems.

Solana (SOL) Stays Dominant, Will Ethereum (ETH) Survive Unseen Stalemate? U.Today - Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency that started as a joke but became a favorite of the masses, including Elon Musk, has recently experienced a significant breakout.

After a period of consolidation, DOGE has broken past a critical resistance level, stirring excitement among traders and investors. The coin is currently sitting above the $0.088 mark, which previously acted as substantial resistance. If DOGE manages to maintain its position above this level, it could solidify this area as new support.

Dogecoin/USDT Chart by TradingViewA break above the $0.095 resistance could signal a continued bullish trend, potentially leading Dogecoin to test the psychological barrier of $0.10. If the momentum is sustained and market sentiment remains positive, DOGE could attempt to reach higher highs, possibly moving toward the $0.105 to $0.11 range last seen during its peak periods of trading activity.

Immediate support for DOGE is now at $0.088 which, if held, could act as a springboard for further climbs. However, should Dogecoin fail to maintain this level, it might fall back to its previous support near $0.078, where buyers have historically shown interest.

A scenario where DOGE's breakout continues would likely involve increased adoption news or a resurgence of interest in meme coins, potentially sparked by social media or celebrity endorsements. Such catalysts could drive demand and push DOGE past the $0.095 level, cementing its breakout status.

Conversely, if the breakout fails to sustain, perhaps due to broader market bearishness or fading interest, DOGE could slide back below $0.088. This would retest the resilience of the $0.078 support. A drop below this level could lead to a bearish phase, with DOGE potentially seeking lower ground.

Solana shows strength
During this market cycle, Solana has established itself as a leader. With its stable and easily scalable performance, it outpaces giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as the majority of DeFi volume went to the ""Ethereum killer.""
As the DeFi ecosystem on Solana flourishes, it is becoming a hub for innovation, blending meme culture with decentralized applications. The network's efficiency and scalability are attracting a wide array of developers.

The cryptocurrency that has been on a strong upward trajectory. Currently, Solana is testing a resistance level at approximately $100, a significant psychological and technical barrier. A convincing break above this level could signal continued bullish momentum, potentially leading to testing the next resistance zone around $108, which coincides with recent highs.

On the downside, the 50-day moving average, sitting near $93.23, is providing dynamic support. This level has been defended multiple times, indicating its importance to traders. If Solana can maintain its footing above this moving average, it would reinforce the asset's stability and could serve as a springboard for further gains.

The next crucial test for Solana will be sustaining above $100. Should it consolidate above this level, it would not be unrealistic to envision a push toward $108, or even higher, as the market reassesses Solana's value proposition in the context of a rapidly evolving DeFi and NFT landscape.

Fundamental Ethereum problems
As it struggles to gain momentum, Ethereum's scalability suffering and the diminishing traction of meme coins on its network are at the forefront of the bearish case for the second-biggest cryptocurrency on the market.
The network's inability to handle high transaction volumes without exorbitant fees has led to the sentiment that Ethereum is becoming ""unusable"" for the day-to-day transactions that meme coins require.

From a technical standpoint, Ethereum's price analysis paints a picture of uncertainty. The asset has been struggling to maintain momentum above crucial support levels. Currently, Ethereum is wavering around the $2,250 mark, with immediate support near the $2,150 level. A break below this support could see a decline toward the $2,000 psychological barrier, which would represent a significant bearish development.

Layer-2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum have emerged as potential stopgaps, offering faster and cheaper transactions. However, their adoption has been less than stellar, with many viewing these platforms as temporary fixes rather than a comprehensive solution to Ethereum's underlying scalability problems.

"Arbitrum (ARB) Rally Halted, Ethereum (ETH) Makes Important Reminder, Did Solana (SOL) Hit Ceiling?","U.Today - The leading layer-2 solution in the Ethereum ecosystem, Arbitrum, has recently seen a significant rally, but this has been interrupted, indicating a potential reversal in its price trajectory.

ARB's price movement had been bullish, as evidenced by its ascent past the moving averages, which served as dynamic support levels during its uptrend. However, the price has encountered substantial resistance, leading to a halt in its rally.

ARB/USDT Chart by TradingViewThe chart demonstrates ARB's struggle to maintain its upward momentum, with the token facing a critical resistance level at approximately $2.00. After failing to breach this threshold, ARB experienced a pullback, currently trading around $1.80.

The support levels to watch are strategically positioned at $1.68 and $1.47, which could provide a safety net for the price if the downward pressure persists. It may also find a stronger base at $1.32, a level that could be fundamental for buyers to reenter the market. Conversely, a bounce off the support could signal a potential for growth, with a retest of the $2.00 resistance level and possible breakout.

Ethereum shows some aggression
As the cryptocurrency market continues its dynamic ebb and flow, Ethereum (ETH) provides a salient reminder of its resilience and potential for growth. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has recently seen a reversal in its price, suggesting a potential shift in market sentiment and positioning.
The price analysis of Ethereum shows a significant level of activity around the $2,400 price point, suggesting this is a key resistance level. After a period of upward movement, ETH's price action indicates a halt and potential retracement from this level. This movement could be indicative of the market catching its breath after a period of accumulation.

Despite ETH's uptick in movement, it has not mirrored the performance of some of its contemporaries like Solana, or even Bitcoin. While these cryptocurrencies have seen more robust growth, Ethereum's progression appears more measured, possibly due to its already substantial market penetration and the maturation of its ecosystem.

The support levels for Ethereum stand firmly at around $2,197 and $2,033, which are crucial if Ethereum were to sustain a further drop in price. These levels may act as a springboard for price recovery should market conditions remain favorable. Conversely, the resistance level at approximately $2,400 is proving to be a formidable barrier to overcome.

The current technical outlook suggests Ethereum may indeed rally to test the $2,400 resistance level again. However, investors should be prepared for a possible retracement following this test. The interplay of support and resistance levels will be crucial in determining ETH's price trajectory in the short term.

Solana's rally on pause?
Solana has recently hit a metaphorical ceiling, as the fervor around the DeFi industry and meme coins that once propelled its value upward has begun to decline. This cooling on the NFT market has contributed to the deceleration in SOL's price momentum, as evidenced by the latest price charts.
A close analysis of the SOL price chart indicates a reversal from its upward trajectory, with the asset facing resistance at approximately $101. The resistance level has proven to be a formidable barrier, with Solana struggling to maintain the bullish momentum it had gained in the past.

Support levels for Solana are observed around the $94 and $76 marks. These levels may offer some respite to the asset’s price if the downward pressure continues. If Solana dips to these support levels and holds, it could signal the potential for recovery and another attempt to break through the current resistance.

Despite the recent slowdown, Solana has indeed had an impressive run. Its ecosystem continues to develop, and while the immediate future may not look as bright as it once did, the possibility of a rebound remains. The market’s cyclical nature and the potential for innovation within Solana’s platform could provide the necessary catalyst for another period of growth.

"ChainLink (LINK) Price Explosion: What Happened? Ethereum (ETH) Price Rally Lacks Backbone, Can Bitcoin (BTC) Break Through 50 EMA?","U.Today - Chainlink has surged ahead of the rest of the crypto market with an explosive 16% rally in the last two days. This rally can be attributed to a variety of factors, not least of which is the activity spike in previously dormant wallets, signaling a resurgence of movement within the Chainlink ecosystem.

The analytics have revealed an Age Consumed spike of 5.38 billion, a metric that measures the multiplication of coins moved by the number of days they had remained passive. This sudden mobilization of LINK tokens has injected volatility and liquidity onto the market, fueling the price ascent.

LINK/USDT Chart by TradingViewFrom a technical standpoint, Chainlink's price has breached crucial resistance levels, now attempting to establish new support. The price has soared past the $15.29 mark, which previously acted as a significant resistance barrier. This breakthrough suggests robust bullish sentiment, with the potential for further growth if the momentum is sustained.

The next resistance lies at approximately $18.39, a level that, if conquered, could bolster confidence in Chainlink's uptrend. Conversely, should there be a retracement, the $14.29 level may serve as a new support, providing a safety net for the price. A dip below this could see LINK testing the $13.18 support zone, where buyers may step in to prop up the market.

No power for Ethereum
Ethereum, the second-largest decentralized network by market capitalization, is experiencing a period of stagnation, with its anticipated price rally showing signs of faltering. Despite Ethereum's prominence in the blockchain space, the network is seeing a significant challenge from competitors like Solana, which has been capturing a growing share of blockchain activity.
A closer look at Ethereum's price movement reveals a lack of momentum that could be attributed to the decrease in on-chain traction and volume. Ethereum's price is currently consolidating around the $2,300 mark, struggling to find the strength for a decisive move. The key resistance level to watch is at $2,337, where the token has faced repeated rejections. A breakthrough above this point could potentially lead to a test of the $2,450 zone, offering a glimmer of hope for bullish momentum.

However, the support levels paint a cautious picture, with $2,193 serving as the immediate floor. A breach below this could see prices slide toward the $2,042 level, which could further dampen market sentiment. The lack of volume accompanying recent price movements suggests a tentative market, with investors possibly waiting for a stronger sign of a trend reversal before committing to more substantial positions.

Bitcoin aims for breakthrough
Bitcoin has recently made a bold move, slicing through the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a key technical resistance level. This breakthrough is a sign of strength from the leading cryptocurrency, indicating a potential reversal from its recent price consolidation.
The 50 EMA has historically acted as a litmus test for Bitcoin's short-term trend direction. A sustained move above this line could validate bullish sentiment among investors, as the cryptocurrency tries to establish a new foothold for further gains. Currently, Bitcoin's price is hovering around the $42,000 mark, attempting to solidify its position above the 50 EMA.

In terms of price analysis, the successful breach of the 50 EMA has set the stage for Bitcoin to test the next resistance level near $43,500. This level is critical as a break above could pave the way for a move toward the $45,000 resistance zone. However, it is essential to note that Bitcoin needs to maintain its current momentum to prevent fallbacks below the 50 EMA, which could dampen the optimistic outlook.

Ethereum (ETH) Staking Ratio Surprisingly Keeps Surging Despite Shapella,"U.Today - Ki Young Ju, founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, leading on-chain analytical firm, shared his views on the Ethereum (ETH) staking progress. He admits he was wrong about Shapella hard fork's effects.

Ethereum (ETH) staking ratio surges to 24% and counting
Ethereum (ETH) staking ratio, i.e., the percentage of ETH coins locked in staking, reaches 24% and keeps surging. Meanwhile, only 11% of the ETH supply is stored on centralized exchanges. The data was shared by Ki Young Ju on X today, on Jan. 18, 2024.
As such, it is safe to say that the overhyped Ethereum (ETH) upgrade Shapella that allowed stakers to withdraw their coins for the first time since December 2020 did not result in massive unstaking:

Ethereum's (ETH) Shapella was activated in April 2023. As crypto markets were still dominated by bearish sentiment, analysts were expecting withdrawals and consecutive sell-offs of Ethereum (ETH).

The Ethereum (ETH) price also managed to go through this event without significant losses: as stakers withdrew 1 million Ethers (ETH) in first week post-Shapella, the ETH price was fluctuating between $2,000 and $2,100.

Staked Ethereums (ETH) are mostly profitable, Mr. Ki Young Ju adds. While the realized price for staking inflows is $2,014, the current ETH rate is $2,519. As such, the average Ether ""stake"" is being held with a significant 25% profit.

The aggregated volume of the Ethereum (ETH) staking ecosystem is estimated at a whopping $72 billion, with 4.25% in APY, Staking Rewards data says.

Сardano (ADA) staking close to surpassing Solana (SOL)
At the same time, the largest Ethereum (ETH) competitors might be close to a historic ""flippening."" The Solana (SOL) staking ratio is plummeting. The indicator lost over 20% in the last week and dipped below 67%.
Meanwhile, the Cardano (ADA) staking ecosystem added 0.06% in the last seven days and is getting closer to 64%. At the same time, the USD-denominated volume of Solana (SOL) staking is over 200% larger than that of Cardano (ADA).

Out of all mainstream altcoins, Mina Protocol (MINA) demonstrates the largest staking ratio: its stakers locked over 91% of the circulating supply.

Aptos (APT) and Sui (SUI) follow the Mina Protocol (MINA) with 85%-86% in staking ratio.

"Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin Makes Surprising Visit to Binance, SHIB Rep Shares Shibarium's Plans to Onboard Thousands of Projects: Crypto News Digest by U.Today","U.Today - Take a look at the most important crypto events with U.Today's top three news stories.

Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin makes surprising visit to Binance
As has been recently shared by Binance CEO Richard Teng on the X platform, Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin made a surprising visit to the Binance office. Teng thanked Buterin for finding time to speak to his team in person, saying that it was a privilege to have him in the company's office. This spontaneous visit caused quite a stir in the crypto community, with many users speculating about a potential collaboration between these two giants of the crypto market. As a reminder, Binance is currently struggling with a $4 billion fine and ongoing regulatory challenges; considering this, Buterin's focus (described in his essay entitled ""Make Ethereum Cypherpunk Again"") on security, privacy and scalability, and concern for centralized exchanges and their vulnerability to hacking, feed rumors about possible cooperation between Buterin and Binance. However, neither Buterin nor Teng made any statements in this regard.
Shibarium: Thousands of projects to join L2 network with numerous partnerships – SHIB rep
In a recent X post, Shiba Inu team member Lucie shared Shibarium's plans for the future. Lucie wrote that the layer-2 solution aims to ""onboard 1,000 projects with numerous partnerships,"" reminding the community that supporting new projects does not necessarily mean canceling existing ones. The SHIB representative then called on all meme token supporters to stay strong as a community during challenging times, stating that there is hardly any point in giving up now if they got ""this far"" in their support for the project's team. Lucie's post has evoked mixed reactions among SHIB army members; even though many of them praised the SHIB developers, some users questioned the project team's ability to accomplish anything more than just making plans and promising new advances.
JPMorgan: Bitcoin ETF hype cooling
According to Kenneth Worthington, analyst at JPMorgan, the initial enthusiasm surrounding Bitcoin ETFs may be waning, with a shift toward a ""more normalized flow environment"" being potentially on the horizon. On Jan. 26, spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced net sales of about $15 million following a four-day streak of redemptions. This reversal could be an indication of changing investor sentiment on these novel financial products. Since their launch, the Bitcoin price has plunged by about 9% but has since stabilized around $42,000 as the new trading week gets underway. Previously, JPMorgan correctly predicted that the approval of Bitcoin ETFs would be a sell-the-news event. Before the approval, the price of the leading cryptocurrency dropped from above $47,000 to below $39,000. The sell-off coincided with large outflows from Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which transitioned into a spot Bitcoin ETF after the SEC's approval.

"XRP, BTC, ETH Show Surprising Profitability Trend, Biggest Signal to Watch","U.Today - According to on-chain analytics firm Santiment, major cryptocurrencies Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP are displaying an intriguing profitability trend.

In a new tweet, Santiment noted that Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP Ledger all have more than 80% of existing supplies in profit. This trend was last observed in March 2022. Bitcoin, ETH and XRP are presently marking 83%, 84% and 81% of their supplies in profit.

The ""Total Supply in Profit"" metric is an excellent way to determine how much the total supply on a network is up or down at any given time. This is a simple technique to determine whether a coin is worth more or less today than it was when it was initially minted, mined or entered circulation.

Meanwhile, the percent of total supply in profit analyzes whether the percentage of supply available at any particular time, rather than the total number of coins on a network, is up or down at any given time. This represents a binary way of seeing the ratio of the total supply simply being in profit, even if it is a very small profit.

That said, Santiment states that BTC, XRP and ETH have their supplies at historically high-risk profit levels compared to their averages, which have been in the 55%-75% range since 2018.

The percentage of total supply in profit offers shorter-term perspectives on how the network is profiting or losing value on its investments over time.

This matters because crypto is a zero-sum game. When networks are heavily profiting, according to this metric, then it is imperative to watch out.

This does not rule out further upside moves for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies due to more exposure from ETFs and other positive news; however, there might be something else to watch out for.

According to Santiment, a great signal to watch that would imply continued long-term growth would be a breach below 75% of their supplies in profit once again.

In a new tweet, Santiment noted that Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP Ledger all have more than 80% of existing supplies in profit. This trend was last observed in March 2022. Bitcoin, ETH and XRP are presently marking 83%, 84% and 81% of their supplies in profit.

The ""Total Supply in Profit"" metric is an excellent way to determine how much the total supply on a network is up or down at any given time. This is a simple technique to determine whether a coin is worth more or less today than it was when it was initially minted, mined or entered circulation.

Meanwhile, the percent of total supply in profit analyzes whether the percentage of supply available at any particular time, rather than the total number of coins on a network, is up or down at any given time. This represents a binary way of seeing the ratio of the total supply simply being in profit, even if it is a very small profit.

"Here's Who Burned 9,001 ETH in Last 30 Days","U.Today - Uniswap, the world’s largest decentralized exchange, is apparently a top burner of Ethereum, with a staggering 9,001 ETH incinerated from the circulating supply in the last 30 days. This activity firmly positions Uniswap as a key player in the Ethereum ecosystem, not just in terms of volume but also in influencing the coin's scarcity.

The mechanism behind Ethereum's burn is a recent upgrade known as EIP-1559, which introduced a transaction fee burn for every operation made on the network. Uniswap, as the leading DEX, handles a massive volume of transactions, naturally leading to a higher rate of ETH being burned. This burn acts as a deflationary force on the supply of Ethereum, theoretically creating scarcity that could bolster the asset's value over the long term.

ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewHowever, the correlation between burn rate and immediate price action is not linear. While Uniswap's significant contribution to the burn rate underscores its dominance, the short-term impact on Ethereum’s price is subdued. Over a longer horizon, this deflationary mechanism is expected to establish a supportive base for the price of ETH, as reducing supply, ceteris paribus, should increase the value of each remaining ETH.

It is important to note, though, that scarcity alone does not guarantee value growth. The intrinsic value of Ethereum also hinges on its utility, adoption and broader market sentiment. Currently, Ethereum is facing stiff competition from Solana in ecosystem growth, with many traders who favor volatility and risk gravitating toward Solana.

A technical analysis of Ethereum's current price action shows a challenging market phase. Ethereum is attempting to hold support around the $2,400 level. Should it fail to sustain this, the next key support is observed at the $2,300 mark, near the 50-day EMA. A breach below this could see Ethereum test the $2,000 psychological support level. Conversely, if Ethereum can rally past the immediate resistance at $2,500, it could pave the way to retest previous highs near $2,800.

Bitcoin and Ethereum Bulls Taking Control: $60 Million of Shorts Liquidated Ahead of Weekend,"U.Today - The cryptocurrency market is witnessing a strong bullish momentum as Bitcoin and Ethereum bulls start to assert control. In a significant development, shorts worth approximately $60 million have been liquidated, signaling a potential shift in market sentiment as we approach the weekend.

Analyzing the current charts, Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience, managing to sustain above the crucial support level of $40,000. The coin has recently experienced a rebound from this level, which has historically acted as a strong psychological barrier for both bulls and bears.

Source: CoinglassIf BTC maintains its position above this support, the next key resistance to watch will be around $42,000, a level where we might expect some consolidation before a further push. On the downside, if the $40,000 level fails to hold, traders should look for potential support near the $38,500 region.

Ethereum, on the other hand, is also showing signs of recovery after a recent sell-off. The coin has found support near the $2,100 mark, just above the 200-day exponential moving average, which is often considered a significant indicator of long-term trends.

If ETH can sustain this rebound, the immediate resistance is expected at $2,400. A breakthrough above this could open the path toward $2,500, a level that previously acted as both support and resistance. A fall below the current support level could see the price testing the next support zone around $2,000.

The liquidation heatmap provides additional context, illustrating the pressure on short sellers as the market moves against their positions. This liquidation is particularly evident in the case of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have seen a significant number of short positions being closed in a short span of time. Overall, the market is currently displaying bullish signs, with strong support levels holding up.

Vitalik Buterin Answers Major Bitcoin and Ethereum Question in Birthday Essay,"U.Today - Renowned Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin celebrated his 30 birthday today by releasing a thoughtful essay titled ""The End of My Childhood."" The essay delves into the genesis of cryptocurrencies, and Bitcoin in particular, underscoring its initial purpose as a response to the vulnerabilities of traditional banking systems.

In his reflective piece, Buterin questions the evolution of public discourse within the crypto space over the past 15 years, pondering whether the original narrative emphasizing financial disruption has waned. To address this, he proposes two pragmatic approaches for the crypto ecosystem.

First, Buterin advocates for a renewed emphasis on the significance of money and finance, urging the crypto space to actively contribute to serving underserved populations and fostering financial inclusion. Second, he envisions a broader role for crypto that extends beyond finance.

Highlighting the unique decentralized nature of the crypto industry, Buterin notes that developers are dispersed globally, and many major crypto projects are not bound by geographical constraints. He emphasizes the potential of non-Western developers to understand and address the concrete needs of users in low-income countries.

Ideal reality by Vitalik Buterin
Buterin's vision for Ethereum goes beyond financial applications. He envisions ETH as the foundation for a decentralized tech stack, emphasizing trustworthiness, democracy and privacy. Zero-knowledge proofs are identified as a key innovation in achieving these goals, offering a nuanced approach to issues of authenticity, manipulation and privacy.

"Samson Mow Takes Subtle Jab at Ethereum (ETH), Is XRP Next?","U.Today - Samson Mow, the chief executive officer of investment firm Jan3 and prominent Bitcoin (BTC) bull and evangelist, has taken his advocacy for the top coin to a new level. In his latest post on X, he took a subtle jab at alternative investment assets, including Silver and Ethereum (ETH), as his way of reducing their viability in comparison to their counterparts Gold and Silver.

Samson Mow analogy
According to Samson Mow, Silver is the poor man’s Gold, a statement that shows that investors who consider the latter to be too expensive typically opt in for the former. While both are respected metals and investment assets, Gold is still considered the superior of the two.
Samson Mow deflated Ethereum’s ego to end the long-standing superiority debate with Bitcoin. The vocal investor noted that ""Ethereum is the stupid man's Bitcoin,"" a statement that spooked members of the ETH community.

By valuation, Bitcoin’s market cap currently stands at $809,923,408,001, while that of Ethereum comes in at $297,575,053,741. The price differentials of $41,344.01 to $2,476.66 also show that Bitcoin is the most valuable of the two. Over time, there have been conversations about shifting capital from BTC to ETH, a trend that might be amplified in the coming months if Ethereum’s key fundamentals come into play.

The harsh criticism of Ethereum did not go down well with its community members, with some pointing out the key improvements the protocol has made as a blockchain in itself.

Is XRP next?
As a Bitcoin Maxi, Samson Mow was asked by one of the commenters on his post what he thinks about XRP if Ethereum is the poor man’s Bitcoin. He simply answered that the demand is a ""tricky one.""

Ethereum (ETH) Needs These 3 Crucial Factors to Align for Growth: Details,"U.Today - Despite Ethereum's position as a frontrunner in the altcoin sector, its growth has been stunted by a bearish trend that has held a tight grip on the market in recent weeks. A closer look at the ETH chart reveals that the expected volatility spike that could catalyze a bullish reversal has yet to materialize.

Layer-2 network adoption and ecosystem expansion
First, the surge of layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism could be a catalyst for Ethereum's growth. These networks aim to enhance Ethereum's ecosystem by providing the much-needed scalability and reduced fees, potentially driving renewed interest and increased adoption of the Ethereum network.
ETH/USD Chart by TradingView

Scalability and network efficiency
Second, Ethereum's persistent scalability issues must be addressed. Despite the implementation of EIP-1559, which was anticipated to make transaction fees more predictable, the network still struggles under high demand, leading to exorbitant fees and reduced network functionality. Resolving these scalability woes is crucial, as a more efficient and cost-effective network is vital for Ethereum to retain its value and utility.
Introduction of Ethereum ETF
Finally, the establishment of an Ethereum ETF would be a strong bullish signal, mirroring the impact of the Bitcoin ETF. An Ethereum ETF would pave the way for institutional investment, providing a regulated and accessible means for traditional investors to gain exposure to ETH. This could secure Ethereum's future as a mainstream financial asset and provide a stable foundation for long-term growth.
Looking at the Ethereum chart, we identify a local resistance level at approximately $2433.5, a price point that has acted as a hurdle in recent trading sessions. For a bullish case to solidify, Ethereum needs to break past this resistance with conviction. Should this occur, it could signal a shift in investor sentiment and open the path to higher price levels.

Ethereum (ETH) Faces Serious Bug; Here's Who Might Be Affected,"U.Today - Ethereum is potentially facing a significant bug that has emerged, previously only assumed as a hypothetical scenario in discussions among the developer and validator community back in March 2022, but now it looms as a potential threat that could become a reality.

This bug concerns the Ethereum staking mechanism and how the network reaches consensus. In essence, if a majority client, holding more than 2/3 of the stake, has a bug, it could inadvertently build an invalid chain that the network would consider finalized due to the majority stake's ""agreement.""

If validators running this buggy client commit to this incorrect chain, any attempt to switch to a correct chain could result in severe penalties due to how the Ethereum protocol is designed to penalize what it sees as ""equivocating"" validators.

What makes this situation particularly alarming is the scale of the potential impact. If this bug manifests, the validators could find themselves in a predicament where they either continue to support an incorrect chain or switch to a correct one at great personal cost. The validators running the buggy client would face a dilemma: lose their stake through penalties or persist with an invalid chain, endangering the network's integrity.

For the average Ethereum holder not involved in staking or blockchain development, this might seem distant, but the implications can be far-reaching. An individual commented that the situation is ""pretty scary,"" and it is also the main reason why they do not stake any ETH. This sentiment reflects a potentially surging concern among holders who fear the ripple effects a bug of this magnitude could have on the network's trust and stability.

Centralized exchanges (CEXes), although well capitalized, might also feel the effect of potential finalization issues. Though their liquidity is far more resilient, mitigating large losses might still become an issue.

"Ethereum Whale Moves $46 Million in ETH Across Binance, Bitfinex and Aave: Details","U.Today - In a surprising move that has captured the attention of the cryptocurrency community, an Ethereum (ETH) whale has orchestrated a series of transactions involving major exchanges, moving a staggering $46.02 million in ETH over the past two days. The entity, utilizing a network of eight wallets, withdrew funds from Binance and Bitfinex before staking with Lido, a liquid staking solution.

Blockchain analytics platform Spot On Chain first brought attention to the substantial transactions through a tweet, revealing intricate details of the massive ETH movement. The whale withdrew the Ethereum holdings from crypto exchanges Binance and Bitfinex at an average price of approximately $2,419.

Subsequently, five wallets were employed to withdraw 50.15 million USDT from Aave, a prominent DeFi protocol, to the CEX trading platform, exchanging the stablecoin for 19,021 ETH, equivalent to the $46.02 million value. Spot On Chain further disclosed that three wallets still retained around 30 million USDT in Aave, sparking speculation that they might deposit these funds into a CEX soon, potentially acquiring more ETH.

Ethereum price struggles
The timing of these transactions coincided with a challenging period for the Ethereum market. At the time of the whale's activity, the price of ETH struggled, recording a 4.57% dip in the last 24 hours and a 9.46% decline in the past week. Current market data indicates ETH trading at $2,296.
Coinglass, another analytics platform, reported a significant amount of liquidations for ETH within the last 24 hours, totaling $53.78 million. Of this amount, $47.48 million resulted from long liquidations, while short liquidations accounted for $6.29 million. The liquidation data underscores the volatility and uncertainty prevalent on the market, with traders experiencing significant losses.

The entity, utilizing a network of eight wallets, withdrew funds from Binance and Bitfinex before staking with Lido, a liquid staking solution.

Blockchain analytics platform Spot On Chain first brought attention to the substantial transactions through a tweet, revealing intricate details of the massive ETH movement. The whale withdrew the Ethereum holdings from crypto exchanges Binance and Bitfinex at an average price of approximately $2,419.

Subsequently, five wallets were employed to withdraw 50.15 million USDT from Aave, a prominent DeFi protocol, to the CEX trading platform, exchanging the stablecoin for 19,021 ETH, equivalent to the $46.02 million value. Spot On Chain further disclosed that three wallets still retained around 30 million USDT in Aave, sparking speculation that they might deposit these funds into a CEX soon, potentially acquiring more ETH.

Ethereum price struggles
The timing of these transactions coincided with a challenging period for the Ethereum market. At the time of the whale's activity, the price of ETH struggled, recording a 4.57% dip in the last 24 hours and a 9.46% decline in the past week. Current market data indicates ETH trading at $2,296.
Coinglass, another analytics platform, reported a significant amount of liquidations for ETH within the last 24 hours, totaling $53.78 million. Of this amount, $47.48 million resulted from long liquidations, while short liquidations accounted for $6.29 million. The liquidation data underscores the volatility and uncertainty prevalent on the market, with traders experiencing significant losses.

Ripple Shares Big Update on XRP Ethereum Sidechain Launch,"U.Today - In a tweet, RippleX shared the latest update on the XRP Ledger EVM sidechain, developed by blockchain technology firm Peersyst in collaboration with Ripple.

In line with this, RippleX delivers an update from Peersyst, which discusses the progress and upcoming news. Peersyst highlighted that 2024 has started, being closer than ever to the launch of the long-awaited EVM sidechain for XRP Ledger.

The RippleX team has already published the XChainBridge public amendment, which is now open for voting. This is a necessary prerequisite for the launch of the EVM sidechain, and validators have currently cast 7 of the 28 votes required.

Regarding the work done thus far, Peersyst stated that the sidechain is more advanced than ever before; after the audit with Bishop Fox, a second one has been carried out, whose details will be published soon.

The latest upgrades are being deployed, and the Cosmos SDK has gotten a blockchain update. Validators will soon be able to vote on the upgrade, which will incorporate Cosmos version 0.47 and Ethereum's EIP3855.

In addition, a new version of the bridge is on its way, allowing users to automatically and dynamically bridge any existing token on the EVM sidechain to the XRP Ledger. This would enable the EVM sidechain to serve as a gateway and connection to the rest of the EVMs, facilitating transactions and the use of all XRP Ledger Mainnet functionalities for all of these assets.

A new UI has also been implemented to improve usability and allow for dynamic bridging between any sidechain, wallet and token. Meanwhile, a bridge SDK has been implemented to help developers create applications that leverage the bridge to access both networks.

Also, the latest version of the Blockscout Explorer is being developed. In addition to an improved UX/UI and other additional functions for verifying and executing smart contracts, the explorer would also provide a new dynamic display of dApps.

Earlier in January, XRP Ledger developers announced the release of rippled 2.0, which includes two major feature enhancements: XLS-38 Cross-Chain Bridge and XLS-40 Decentralized Identity.

The Cross-Chain Bridge would allow XRP and fungible tokens issued on the XRPL to move seamlessly between the XRPL Mainnet and XRPL sidechains, as well as between the XRPL Mainnet and the upcoming EVM sidechain.

Ethereum (ETH) Becomes Target of Massive $1 Billion Sell-Off: Who's Responsible?,"U.Today - Ethereum is encountering a massive sell-off exceeding $1 billion. The source of this enormous market movement can be traced back to Celsius, which reportedly transferred a staggering 459,561 ETH, valued at approximately $1.014 billion, to various exchanges.

The distribution of this sell-off was as follows: 297,454 ETH ($656.5 million) moved to Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) Prime, 146,507 ETH to Paxos Treasury and smaller amounts of 7,800 ETH each, totaling $17.2 million, were transferred to FalconX and Coinbase. Despite this massive transfer, Celsius reportedly retains a reserve of 62,468 ETH, worth around $139 million.

Such a colossal sale exerts immense pressure on Ethereum's price and could significantly sway market sentiment. The immediate concern for investors and traders is whether Ethereum's liquidity and market capitalization can absorb such a hit without triggering a broad market downturn.

From a technical analysis standpoint, the massive outflow from Celsius is a bearish signal, likely to test Ethereum's local support levels. A crucial support to watch is around the $2,000 price range, a psychological and technical support level, which, if breached, could see the price tumble to the next significant support at $1,800. This level has historically acted as a strong buy zone and may serve as a robust defense against further declines.

Conversely, resistance levels have become more formidable due to the sell-off. Any potential recovery will have to confront the resistance at $2,200, which previously acted as a support level. A break above this could see Ethereum attempt to reclaim higher price levels, possibly testing the $2,400 resistance.

The substantial sell-off initiated by Celsius has placed Ethereum in a problematic position. Although the Ethereum network's fundamentals remain robust, the asset's price resilience in the face of such a significant sell-off shows the actual state of the market.

$13 Milion in Ethereum (ETH) Destroyed as Supply Becomes Deflationary Again,"U.Today - The recent data from Ethereum network indicates that the supply of Ethereum has once again entered a deflationary phase. Over the past 30 days, a striking $13 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) has been destroyed, with the net supply change showing a decrease of 5,619.39 ETH. This deflationary pressure is due to the network's burning mechanism, which has incinerated 74,933.24 ETH, outstripping the 69,313.86 ETH issued in the same period.

The implications of this deflationary trend could signal an approaching rally for Ethereum. A deflationary supply inherently suggests that the available quantity of ETH is decreasing, which could lead to an increase in value per token, assuming demand stays the same or grows. This dynamic, combined with the Ethereum network's continuous development and adoption, may set the stage for a bullish scenario.

ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewAnalyzing the Ethereum chart, a crucial factor is the potential breakthrough of the 50-day Exponential Moving Average. Currently, Ethereum hovers just below this significant level, and a break above could confirm a shift in market sentiment, potentially igniting upward price movement.

However, it is essential to acknowledge that Ethereum's current market traction is relatively muted. Despite the burn and the deflationary state of supply, the lack of significant network activity or groundbreaking updates has kept the token from gaining substantial momentum. Even activities by Ethereum's cofounder, Vitalik Buterin, which have historically influenced the market, seem to provide only a moderate push at best, under current conditions.

The market awaits a catalyst that could reignite Ethereum's dominance in the blockchain space. While the reduction in supply is a positive sign, without an accompanying increase in demand or network utility, the impact on price may be limited.

Ethereum Closer to Epic Rebranding as Sepolia Welcomes Dencun Upgrade,"U.Today - The Ethereum blockchain is on its way to a massive rebranding as its long-awaited Dencun upgrade is now live on the Sepolia testnet. The Ethereum Foundation projected that the Dencun upgrade would launch on Sepolia by Jan. 30, and the successful integration was revealed by core developer Terrence.eth, for which he received many accolades from the community.

The Dencun upgrade going live on Sepolia is one of the two remaining steps required to launch the update on the Ethereum mainnet. Ethereum has long been plagued with lower scalability and high gas fees. For this, it has continued to receive intense backlash from industry analysts like legendary trader Peter Brandt, who considers its high cost of operation a basis for its demise in the long term.

The Dencun upgrade will attempt to resolve scalability issues while also making Ethereum more cost-effective as a protocol. The Dencun upgrade will specifically introduce proto-danksharding, a compressed data storage mechanism dubbed ""blobs"" to help optimize performance.

Development efforts are now in their advanced stages as the upgrade was launched on the Goerli testnet earlier this month. The last step before the mainnet debut will be to launch on the Holesky testnet, an upgrade that is scheduled for Feb. 7.

Ethereum to fight back against its competitors
Many new protocols have emerged to capitalize on the weakness of the Ethereum protocol. From Solana (SOL) to Cardano (ADA) and even Avalanche (AVAX), the race to dethrone Ethereum remains the core mantra for many developers in the Web3 ecosystem today.
With the Dencun upgrade, many of the pain points on Ethereum can be resolved, thus making the protocol more attractive to developers and end users overall. With the upgrade, Ethereum is poised to extend its dominance as the top blockchain of choice for all things decentralized finance (DeFi) and more.

Major FED Decision to Affect Crypto Market in Two Days,"U.Today - The crypto market is bracing itself as the Federal Reserve gears up to announce its first interest rate decision of 2024. The whispers from the CME about a 96.9% chance to keep interest rates unchanged are causing ripples. Yet, with the second decision in March casting a 47% shadow of a rate cut by 25 basis points (bps), investors are on edge. Adding to the economic fervor, the United States is set to release the January unemployment rate, which could further sway market sentiment.

The Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates is a critical economic lever that traditionally influences traditional markets and, as has been seen, the cryptocurrency market as well. An unchanged interest rate could maintain the status quo, possibly keeping investment steady in assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

A cut, however, could signal economic caution, potentially reducing the attractiveness of risk assets like cryptocurrencies or, conversely, could lead investors to seek higher returns in the crypto market if traditional investments falter.

BTC/USD Chart by TradingViewAnalyzing the Bitcoin chart, there is a distinctive ""war"" between the bulls and bears. The immediate resistance level to watch is around the $42,500 mark, which Bitcoin has been testing recently. This level is crucial because a decisive close above it could signal increasing bullish momentum. On the downside, the support level at approximately $39,528, aligning with a psychological round number and a previous area of interest, is one that traders are likely to defend vigorously.

The upcoming Fed decision could serve as a catalyst for Bitcoin's next big move. If interest rates remain unchanged, Bitcoin could continue to test the resistance level, and a break above could confirm a bullish reversal. However, should rates decrease, Bitcoin's reaction might be even more unpredictable.

Important Bitcoin Statement Made by Crypto Capital Venture CEO Ahead of Halving,"U.Today - Founder of Crypto Capital Venture Dan Gambardello has taken to the X/Twitter social media platform to share an important message regarding Bitcoin and the prospects of the altcoin markets ahead of the approaching Bitcoin halvening.

He suggested the cryptocurrency community should prepare themselves for Bitcoin going parabolic.

Bitcoin halving affecting market already, per Gambardello
Gambardello reminded his Twitter followers from the crypto community that the new Bitcoin halvening event is just several weeks away (scheduled for April).
However, the crypto trader tweeted that the Bitcoin supply shock pressure is already starting to build up. The effect of the upcoming Bitcoin halving is also being strengthened by spot Bitcoin ETF issuers grabbing Bitcoin from cryptocurrency exchanges – BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Fidelity, Ark Invest, VanEck and others (while Grayscale continues to sell Bitcoin).

As reported earlier, prominent Bitcoin maximalist Samson Mow also tweeted several times that he expects a Bitcoin supply shock and Bitcoin demand shock to meet at some point after the halvening takes place.

""Financial institutions eyeing altcoins""
“Bull stampede incoming,” Gambardello concluded. He added that financial institutions are now starting to eye altcoins. Grayscale and BlackRock giants have already filed for launching spot Ethereum ETFs, but the Securities and Exchange Commission keeps delaying its decision on that. Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) banking giant expects the approval to be issued on May 23.
The approval of the Ethereum ETF will potentially cause the ETH price to skyrocket as ETF issuers will also begin to scoop up the second-largest cryptocurrency in large amounts. Crypto YouTuber Lark Davis believes Ethereum is likely to surge to the $4,000 level (a prediction first made by Standard Chartered) on that wave of financial institutions purchasing Ethereum.

Besides, Davis suggested that exchange-traded products based on altcoins other than Ethereum are likely to start emerging. He named Dogecoin, Solana, Chainlink and Avalanche coins as the basis for them in particular. These ETFs may be launched by the end of the year, Davis reckons.

He mentioned the Franklin Templeton fund, which has been tweeting about Solana recently, and in an interview with Bloomberg, the fund’s rep stated that the cryptocurrency market may see more ETFs coming from them soon. In January, they launched a spot Bitcoin ETF, EZBC.

"Shiba Inu (SHIB) Rapidly Breaks Down, Ethereum (ETH) Loses Traction, While Solana (SOL) Presents Hidden Opportunity","U.Today - Shiba Inu has experienced a significant breakdown from its recent consolidation phase. The chart depicts a clear downward trajectory as SHIB failed to maintain its position within the ascending triangle pattern it had formed over the past few months.

The breakdown was signaled as SHIB prices breached the key support level at $0.000009, which had previously acted as a reliable floor for the price during consolidation phases. Following this, SHIB prices tumbled further, slicing through subsequent support near $0.0000087. This price action marked a decisive shift in market sentiment from accumulation to distribution.

SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewThe next support level to watch is at $0.0000082, where SHIB may find a temporary reprieve from the selling pressure. If this level fails to hold, the next critical support lies at $0.0000076, which could serve as the last line of defense before a more significant drop.

For a reversal to occur and for SHIB to regain its upward momentum, it would need to reclaim previous support levels and transform them back into supports. This would require a substantial influx of buying pressure, potentially sparked by positive developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem or broader cryptocurrency market rallies.

The first sign of a possible reversal would be a return above $0.0000087, followed by a sustained move above the $0.000009 price level. A breakout above these levels, accompanied by increasing volume, could indicate that the downtrend is losing steam and that bulls are regaining control.

Solana paints reversal pattern
Solana has been developing a subtle yet potentially pivotal chart pattern. The asset has been tracing a slow and steady ascending channel, a formation that suggests a controlled and consistent uptrend. This pattern, characterized by higher lows and higher highs contained within two parallel trendlines, speaks to potential for continued growth.
The significance of this pattern lies in the momentum it could provide for SOL. Should the price action remain strong within the upper half of the channel, and particularly if it challenges the upper trendline, we could see Solana break through and embark on a more aggressive rally.

Such a bullish scenario would likely be supported by increased trading volume and positive developments within the Solana ecosystem, such as new project launches or updates that enhance network performance.

The immediate local resistance stands at around $55, and a confident push beyond this could confirm bullish sentiment. Inversely, if Solana's price dips below the channel's lower boundary, around $48, it could indicate that a bearish narrative is taking hold.

Ethereum momentum decreasing
Ethereum is exhibiting signs of waning momentum, as observed in recent price movements. The asset, which has long been considered the backbone of the decentralized finance sector, is facing a pivotal moment that could determine its trajectory for the coming weeks.
The provided chart illustrates Ethereum's struggle to maintain its grasp on the market. The price has been on a downward trend, edging closer to the local 26-day Exponential Moving Average. This level, currently near $2,465, is critical; if Ethereum fails to hold this line, we might see it descend to test the more significant 50 EMA, which stands around the $2,300 mark.

The 26 EMA serves as a short-term sentiment gauge, and its breach could signal a lack of immediate bullish support. Should this level fail to act as a springboard for price recovery, Ethereum's next stop could indeed be the 50 EMA. A breach below this longer-term moving average could potentially open the gates for a test of lower support levels, highlighting the need for investors to brace for more volatility.

Market participants are now recalibrating their expectations, understanding that the road to sustainable gains is a long-term journey.

SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewThe next support level to watch is at $0.0000082, where SHIB may find a temporary reprieve from the selling pressure. If this level fails to hold, the next critical support lies at $0.0000076, which could serve as the last line of defense before a more significant drop.

For a reversal to occur and for SHIB to regain its upward momentum, it would need to reclaim previous support levels and transform them back into supports. This would require a substantial influx of buying pressure, potentially sparked by positive developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem or broader cryptocurrency market rallies.

The first sign of a possible reversal would be a return above $0.0000087, followed by a sustained move above the $0.000009 price level. A breakout above these levels, accompanied by increasing volume, could indicate that the downtrend is losing steam and that bulls are regaining control.

Solana paints reversal pattern
Solana has been developing a subtle yet potentially pivotal chart pattern. The asset has been tracing a slow and steady ascending channel, a formation that suggests a controlled and consistent uptrend. This pattern, characterized by higher lows and higher highs contained within two parallel trendlines, speaks to potential for continued growth.
The significance of this pattern lies in the momentum it could provide for SOL. Should the price action remain strong within the upper half of the channel, and particularly if it challenges the upper trendline, we could see Solana break through and embark on a more aggressive rally.

Such a bullish scenario would likely be supported by increased trading volume and positive developments within the Solana ecosystem, such as new project launches or updates that enhance network performance.

The immediate local resistance stands at around $55, and a confident push beyond this could confirm bullish sentiment. Inversely, if Solana's price dips below the channel's lower boundary, around $48, it could indicate that a bearish narrative is taking hold.

Ethereum momentum decreasing
Ethereum is exhibiting signs of waning momentum, as observed in recent price movements. The asset, which has long been considered the backbone of the decentralized finance sector, is facing a pivotal moment that could determine its trajectory for the coming weeks.
The provided chart illustrates Ethereum's struggle to maintain its grasp on the market. The price has been on a downward trend, edging closer to the local 26-day Exponential Moving Average. This level, currently near $2,465, is critical; if Ethereum fails to hold this line, we might see it descend to test the more significant 50 EMA, which stands around the $2,300 mark.

The 26 EMA serves as a short-term sentiment gauge, and its breach could signal a lack of immediate bullish support. Should this level fail to act as a springboard for price recovery, Ethereum's next stop could indeed be the 50 EMA. A breach below this longer-term moving average could potentially open the gates for a test of lower support levels, highlighting the need for investors to brace for more volatility.

Market participants are now recalibrating their expectations, understanding that the road to sustainable gains is a long-term journey.

Another Dormant Ethereum Whale With Pre-Mined ETH Suddenly Wakes Up,"U.Today - In a remarkable development within the cryptocurrency sphere, an inactive Ethereum whale, dormant for eight and a half years, has reemerged into the scene by transferring a significant 100 ETH, translating to a substantial $230,159. Etherscan data reveals that this address, dormant since its genesis block in July 2015, has stirred curiosity as it displays activity for the first time.

The awakening saw the whale execute transfers, sending 20 ETH to one undisclosed address and 77 ETH to another, both shrouded in mystery. This resurgence aligns with a recent trend, as another dormant Ethereum address, containing 492 ETH valued at $1.14 million, was activated after a prolonged dormancy since its genesis event, as reported by U.Today last Friday.

Influence on Ethereum price
The sudden activation of these major players in the crypto market prompts speculation about potential ramifications for Ethereum's price. Historical data indicates that similar instances, where substantial volumes were moved by large holders of cryptocurrencies, often triggered market volatility.
ETH to USD by CoinMarketCapDespite a double-digit drop in Ethereum's value following the last awakening of such whales in late May, the cryptocurrency managed to bounce back. Analysts now caution against underestimating the potential risks associated with these dormant whales.

"XRP's Epic Battle Against Bears, Solana Breaks $100, While Ethereum Fights for Momentum","U.Today - XRP is currently locked in a fierce struggle with bearish forces. The digital asset, which operates within the Ripple network, is experiencing difficulty establishing a position above a critical technical indicator — the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).

The 200 EMA serves as an important barometer for the long-term trend and investor sentiment. For XRP, remaining below this level suggests that the asset lacks the bullish momentum needed to shift into an upward trajectory. This inability to secure a foothold above the 200 EMA raises questions about the stability of positive price action in the near term.

XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewTechnical analysis shows that the 200 EMA is a dynamic level of resistance that many traders watch closely. A consistent failure to breach this mark can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy where the resistance level grows stronger, as more traders set their sell orders around this key price point.

Ethereum keeps on struggling
Ethereum is showing signs of losing its upward momentum, failing to form a higher high — an indicator that market experts often interpret as a sign of an impending price correction.
The ETH chart reveals a telling pattern; the absence of a new higher high is significant. Typically, in a bullish market phase, the price of an asset creates a series of higher highs and higher lows. However, Ethereum's inability to push beyond its recent peak may suggest that the bulls are running out of steam and a reevaluation of market sentiment could be underway.

Analyzing the chart, the local resistance level has been a tough ceiling for Ethereum to break. This resistance, where sell orders tend to cluster, is acting as a barrier preventing further upward movement. On the flip side, the support level represents a price point with a concentration of buy orders, offering a potential cushion against a price drop. If Ethereum fails to uphold the support level, it could trigger a price breakdown, signaling a shift to a bearish trend.

If Ethereum's price continues to struggle, the scenario could unfold where the asset drops further, testing subsequent support levels. While the underlying fundamentals of Ethereum, such as network upgrades and adoption rates, remain robust, the short-term price action could still be subject to corrective forces.

Solana wants another round
The battleground of volatility on the crypto market continues, and Solana (SOL) has not been spared from its whims. Once a darling of the crypto world for its speed and efficiency, SOL has recently been up against a wall, struggling to surpass the crucial $100 mark. The price chart reflects a narrative of struggle and resistance, painting a picture of an asset in need of momentum.
The technical outlook for SOL is looking promising. After a period of bullish activity that piqued the interest of many investors, SOL has hit a snag near the $100 resistance level. This resistance level represents a significant psychological and financial barrier, as it is where sell orders tend to accumulate, putting downward pressure on the price.

Despite efforts to rally, the asset has been unable to generate the necessary momentum to overcome this threshold with ease and currently consolidates at it. One of the key factors influencing this lackluster performance could be the market's tepid reaction to the announcement of Solana phone Saga 2. The news, which might have been expected to inject some enthusiasm onto the market, failed to provide substantial support for Solana's price.

Looking at the chart, the local support levels are clearly delineated. The first line of defense for SOL lies around the $88-$90 price range, where previous dips have found buyers waiting. Should this level fail to hold, the next support may not emerge until it reaches the more robust $70 level, which could act as a stronger foothold for the price.

Conversely, resistance beyond $100 is now more formidable than ever. With each rejection, the resolve of buyers weakens, and the $100 level transforms from a mere price point into a crucial psychological level you should not miss.

"Shiba Inu (SHIB) Becoming Bullish, Ethereum (ETH) Price Screams Rally Continuation, Bitcoin (BTC) Not Giving up Market Dominance","U.Today - Shiba Inu currently displays an ascending triangle pattern on the SHIB/USDT chart. This technical formation is widely recognized and could be a signal to a significant price surge for the meme.

An ascending triangle is characterized by a flat upper resistance line and a rising lower support line. This pattern suggests that buyers are gradually gaining ground against sellers, as each dip is bought up at a higher level than the previous one, indicating accumulating pressure for an upward breakout.

SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewFor Shiba Inu, which has been lingering in a period of relatively nonexistent activity, this pattern could serve as massive fuel for volatility in the near future. Recent market conditions have seen a decline in interest toward legacy meme coins, with SHIB being no exception. The lack of significant developments within the Shiba Inu network has contributed to the muted activity around this cryptocurrency.

In contrast, the majority of the action in the meme coin sector has been taking place on the Solana network. This platform has become a hotbed for the deployment of new meme coins, which are exhibiting far greater volatility than those on the Ethereum network, where Shiba Inu resides. The brisk activity on Solana contrasts sharply with the sluggishness observed in Ethereum's meme coin space, drawing in traders and investors looking for quick gains and high excitement.

Ethereum's correction is temporary
The Ethereum market is currently exhibiting a correction, and there are patterns that suggest a rally may not only be on the horizon but could also be in continuation. The asset has recently experienced a sharp downturn, movement that is readily apparent on intraday timeframes. However, such stark movements are often precursors to reversals, signaling that Ethereum could be gearing up for an upswing.
A closer look at the charts shows Ethereum's price action respecting a series of key technical indicators which, together, build a case for potential upward momentum. The asset has been tracing back to touch base with its moving averages, a behavior that is typically followed by a rebound, as these levels can act as dynamic support zones.

This corrective phase is noteworthy, especially considering the robust rally Ethereum enjoyed in the preceding weeks. Corrections are a natural and healthy part of any asset's price trajectory, allowing for consolidation before the next leg up. For Ethereum, the current pullback could be shaking out weak hands, setting the stage for a stronger rally propelled by a more committed investor base.

Bitcoin's dominance not going anywhere
After a brief breach below the 50-day EMA — a critical indicator of medium-term market sentiment — Bitcoin has clawed its way back above this pivotal level. This move indicates a bullish signal for market observers, suggesting that Bitcoin is not yet ready to relinquish its market dominance.
However, the ascent above the 50 EMA has not been met with the kind of vigorous momentum that bulls would hope for. The growth has been moderate, hinting that Bitcoin might encounter selling pressure as it ascends. This is not unusual on the crypto markets, where significant moves often face immediate resistance as traders take profits and skeptics cast doubts.

The recent price action has been a roller coaster for Bitcoin, which saw its value tumble from highs around $47,000 to lows near $41,000. This downturn briefly shifted the spotlight to altcoins, which seized the moment to stage local rallies. The diversification of gains across the crypto spectrum during Bitcoin's periods of weakness is a trend that has become more pronounced as the overall market matures.

Yet Bitcoin's ability to push back above the 50 EMA serves as a reminder of its underlying strength and the confidence investors have placed in it. Despite the opportunity for altcoins to rise, Bitcoin remains the anchor of the crypto market, with its moves often dictating broader market sentiment. This recent rebound above a crucial technical level could be interpreted as Bitcoin's silent assertion that it is not ready to give up the throne just yet.

"Ethereum (ETH) Loses All of Its Gains, Bitcoin (BTC) Not Ready to Give up $40,000, Solana (SOL) Comeback Starts","U.Today - Ethereum has wiped out the gains it had accumulated over a sustained period. The ETH/USD price chart depicts a grim narrative as the digital asset has swiftly descended from its peak, retracing back to levels that question the sustainability of its prior growth.

The steep decline in Ethereum's price is a significant bearish signal. It reflects the market's hesitancy to invest at previous highs, most likely due to the underperformance Ethereum has shown in the recent past. This lack of traction and inability to initiate a recovery underscores the vulnerability of Ethereum's price in the current market climate.

ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewFocusing on the technical aspects, Ethereum has broken through what was once seen as a strong support level at approximately $2,350. This price point, which previously saw substantial buying interest, has now been breached, leading to a cascading effect as the asset searches for new support. The next critical support level is around $2,175, where buyers might emerge to stall the downfall.

Conversely, any attempts at recovery will first encounter resistance at around $2,338, a level that now marks the lower boundary of what was a consolidation range before the drop. A close above this level on significant volume could signal a temporary respite from selling pressure. However, the real test lies at higher resistance levels, previously established around $2,500, where ETH struggled to maintain upward momentum.

Bitcoin ready to fight
Recent candlestick formations portray a scenario where Bitcoin is flirting with a critical resistance level, poised to either confirm a bearish trend or start a substantial recovery.
The chart illustrates Bitcoin’s recent descent, as it lost its foothold at the higher price echelons it previously occupied. However, amid this downward movement, Bitcoin is showing signs of resilience. The latest candles indicate a potential reversal as they hover around a significant support level, which can be identified at approximately $37,000, a region where buyers have historically stepped in.

A sustained hold above this point could catalyze renewed buying interest, which may drive the price toward the immediate resistance level at around $41,000. The significance of reclaiming this threshold cannot be understated, as it may invalidate the bearish outlook and signal a trend reversal.

As for the upper resistances, the $43,000 and $46,000 price levels stand out as notable barriers that Bitcoin would need to breach to cement a robust recovery narrative. Achieving such milestones could sway market sentiment positively, potentially ushering in a wave of optimism among investors.

The moving averages offer additional insight, suggesting a possible bullish crossover should the current momentum persist. This scenario would be further supported by a rise in trading volume, which typically accompanies decisive trend shifts.

Solana among leaders
Solana shows signs of a nascent comeback, presenting a bullish scenario amid a broader market recovery. However, investors tread cautiously, aware of the potential of a ""dead cat bounce"" since volume profiles signal restraint.
Analyzing the SOL/USDT chart, we notice that Solana has established a local support level around the $70 price mark. This is characterized by multiple touches of this level over the past few weeks, each time resisting further downward movement.

On the flip side, the local resistance can be identified near the $96 level, which previously acted as support during Solana's consistent upward trend.

The price movement is currently sandwiched between the 50-day moving average acting as dynamic resistance and the 200-day moving average serving as potential dynamic support. The narrowing gap between these averages could squeeze the price action, possibly leading to a volatility breakout.

"XRP Starts Moving Earlier, Solana (SOL) Already Stronger Than Everyone Else; Does Ethereum (ETH) Need More Fuel?","U.Today - XRP appears to have begun its market movements earlier than anticipated. The chart shows a notable shift from the recent sideways trading pattern, as XRP starts to carve out a new direction.

As of the latest trends, XRP has been testing the support level around $0.50, a crucial psychological threshold for the asset. A sustained move below this level could signal further bearish momentum, potentially leading the price to test the next significant support zone around $0.47.

XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewOn the flip side, if XRP manages to stabilize and bounce back from the current support, the initial resistance is likely to be encountered near the $0.54 mark, where the 50-day moving average currently lies. This moving average has historically acted as a dynamic resistance level, and a breakout above could propel XRP toward the $0.56 level, which aligns with the 100-day moving average.

Further complicating the chart is the downward trendline that has been in play since the local high established in November. This trendline has repeatedly acted as resistance, pushing the price downward each time it has been tested. For a true reversal to be confirmed, XRP would need to break above this trendline with significant volume to validate the move.

Solana is leading pack
Solana is manifesting its strength as the top performer among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Despite overall market volatility, SOL's price action has been signaling a stronger recovery compared to other assets.
At the time of analysis, Solana is trading around the $90 mark, having rebounded with considerable momentum from the support level near $78.35. This pivotal point, bolstered by the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), has served as a springboard for the recent bullish trend. The price of SOL has been consistently creating higher lows, indicative of strong buying interest at these levels.

Resistance for SOL is currently looming at the $100 psychological level, a breakthrough of which could propel the price toward the next significant resistance at $110.

The relative strength of Solana is further substantiated by the resurgence of a risk appetite on the market, particularly evidenced by the blossoming of meme coins. This renewed interest in higher-risk assets typically bodes well for ecosystems like Solana that support a variety of decentralized applications and niche crypto projects.

Ethereum needs push
The Ethereum market is currently facing a confluence of challenges as it searches for the momentum to sustain its position. A recent chart analysis reveals an indecisive atmosphere among investors, with Ethereum struggling to find a strong directional move.
At present, Ethereum is hovering around the $2,200 mark, a level that has seen significant activity and is currently acting as a temporary support. However, the lack of bullish conviction suggests that this support level may not hold if a new wave of selling pressure emerges.

Resistance levels are observed near the $2,400 range, where previous attempts to break higher have been met with a firm rejection, indicating a substantial barrier to upward movement.

The selling pressure is partly attributed to the recent news of Celsius Network liquidating approximately $1 billion worth of Ethereum holdings. This substantial amount has the potential to saturate the market, overwhelming current liquidity and triggering a downturn. As a result, the $2,000 psychological level is eyed as the next critical support zone, a breach of which could see a sharp decline toward the $1,950 region, where the 200-day moving average lies, providing stronger historical support.

On the flip side, if Ethereum can absorb the selling pressure and gain the necessary ""fuel,"" a push above the $2,400 resistance could open the path toward the $2,500 area before challenging the more formidable resistance at $2,600, which aligns with the 50-day moving average.

U.Today - XRP appears to have begun its market movements earlier than anticipated. The chart shows a notable shift from the recent sideways trading pattern, as XRP starts to carve out a new direction.

As of the latest trends, XRP has been testing the support level around $0.50, a crucial psychological threshold for the asset. A sustained move below this level could signal further bearish momentum, potentially leading the price to test the next significant support zone around $0.47.

XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewOn the flip side, if XRP manages to stabilize and bounce back from the current support, the initial resistance is likely to be encountered near the $0.54 mark, where the 50-day moving average currently lies. This moving average has historically acted as a dynamic resistance level, and a breakout above could propel XRP toward the $0.56 level, which aligns with the 100-day moving average.

Further complicating the chart is the downward trendline that has been in play since the local high established in November. This trendline has repeatedly acted as resistance, pushing the price downward each time it has been tested. For a true reversal to be confirmed, XRP would need to break above this trendline with significant volume to validate the move.

"Dogecoin (DOGE) Breakout Occurs, What's Next? Solana (SOL) Stays Dominant, Will Ethereum (ETH) Survive Unseen Stalemate?","U.Today - Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency that started as a joke but became a favorite of the masses, including Elon Musk, has recently experienced a significant breakout.

After a period of consolidation, DOGE has broken past a critical resistance level, stirring excitement among traders and investors. The coin is currently sitting above the $0.088 mark, which previously acted as substantial resistance. If DOGE manages to maintain its position above this level, it could solidify this area as new support.

Dogecoin/USDT Chart by TradingViewA break above the $0.095 resistance could signal a continued bullish trend, potentially leading Dogecoin to test the psychological barrier of $0.10. If the momentum is sustained and market sentiment remains positive, DOGE could attempt to reach higher highs, possibly moving toward the $0.105 to $0.11 range last seen during its peak periods of trading activity.

Immediate support for DOGE is now at $0.088 which, if held, could act as a springboard for further climbs. However, should Dogecoin fail to maintain this level, it might fall back to its previous support near $0.078, where buyers have historically shown interest.

A scenario where DOGE's breakout continues would likely involve increased adoption news or a resurgence of interest in meme coins, potentially sparked by social media or celebrity endorsements. Such catalysts could drive demand and push DOGE past the $0.095 level, cementing its breakout status.

Conversely, if the breakout fails to sustain, perhaps due to broader market bearishness or fading interest, DOGE could slide back below $0.088. This would retest the resilience of the $0.078 support. A drop below this level could lead to a bearish phase, with DOGE potentially seeking lower ground.

Solana shows strength
During this market cycle, Solana has established itself as a leader. With its stable and easily scalable performance, it outpaces giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as the majority of DeFi volume went to the ""Ethereum killer.""
As the DeFi ecosystem on Solana flourishes, it is becoming a hub for innovation, blending meme culture with decentralized applications. The network's efficiency and scalability are attracting a wide array of developers.

The cryptocurrency that has been on a strong upward trajectory. Currently, Solana is testing a resistance level at approximately $100, a significant psychological and technical barrier. A convincing break above this level could signal continued bullish momentum, potentially leading to testing the next resistance zone around $108, which coincides with recent highs.

On the downside, the 50-day moving average, sitting near $93.23, is providing dynamic support. This level has been defended multiple times, indicating its importance to traders. If Solana can maintain its footing above this moving average, it would reinforce the asset's stability and could serve as a springboard for further gains.

The next crucial test for Solana will be sustaining above $100. Should it consolidate above this level, it would not be unrealistic to envision a push toward $108, or even higher, as the market reassesses Solana's value proposition in the context of a rapidly evolving DeFi and NFT landscape.

Fundamental Ethereum problems
As it struggles to gain momentum, Ethereum's scalability suffering and the diminishing traction of meme coins on its network are at the forefront of the bearish case for the second-biggest cryptocurrency on the market.
The network's inability to handle high transaction volumes without exorbitant fees has led to the sentiment that Ethereum is becoming ""unusable"" for the day-to-day transactions that meme coins require.

From a technical standpoint, Ethereum's price analysis paints a picture of uncertainty. The asset has been struggling to maintain momentum above crucial support levels. Currently, Ethereum is wavering around the $2,250 mark, with immediate support near the $2,150 level. A break below this support could see a decline toward the $2,000 psychological barrier, which would represent a significant bearish development.

Layer-2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum have emerged as potential stopgaps, offering faster and cheaper transactions. However, their adoption has been less than stellar, with many viewing these platforms as temporary fixes rather than a comprehensive solution to Ethereum's underlying scalability problems.

"Arbitrum (ARB) Rally Halted, Ethereum (ETH) Makes Important Reminder, Did Solana (SOL) Hit Ceiling?","U.Today - The leading layer-2 solution in the Ethereum ecosystem, Arbitrum, has recently seen a significant rally, but this has been interrupted, indicating a potential reversal in its price trajectory.

ARB's price movement had been bullish, as evidenced by its ascent past the moving averages, which served as dynamic support levels during its uptrend. However, the price has encountered substantial resistance, leading to a halt in its rally.

ARB/USDT Chart by TradingViewThe chart demonstrates ARB's struggle to maintain its upward momentum, with the token facing a critical resistance level at approximately $2.00. After failing to breach this threshold, ARB experienced a pullback, currently trading around $1.80.

The support levels to watch are strategically positioned at $1.68 and $1.47, which could provide a safety net for the price if the downward pressure persists. It may also find a stronger base at $1.32, a level that could be fundamental for buyers to reenter the market. Conversely, a bounce off the support could signal a potential for growth, with a retest of the $2.00 resistance level and possible breakout.

Ethereum shows some aggression
As the cryptocurrency market continues its dynamic ebb and flow, Ethereum (ETH) provides a salient reminder of its resilience and potential for growth. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has recently seen a reversal in its price, suggesting a potential shift in market sentiment and positioning.
The price analysis of Ethereum shows a significant level of activity around the $2,400 price point, suggesting this is a key resistance level. After a period of upward movement, ETH's price action indicates a halt and potential retracement from this level. This movement could be indicative of the market catching its breath after a period of accumulation.

Despite ETH's uptick in movement, it has not mirrored the performance of some of its contemporaries like Solana, or even Bitcoin. While these cryptocurrencies have seen more robust growth, Ethereum's progression appears more measured, possibly due to its already substantial market penetration and the maturation of its ecosystem.

The support levels for Ethereum stand firmly at around $2,197 and $2,033, which are crucial if Ethereum were to sustain a further drop in price. These levels may act as a springboard for price recovery should market conditions remain favorable. Conversely, the resistance level at approximately $2,400 is proving to be a formidable barrier to overcome.

The current technical outlook suggests Ethereum may indeed rally to test the $2,400 resistance level again. However, investors should be prepared for a possible retracement following this test. The interplay of support and resistance levels will be crucial in determining ETH's price trajectory in the short term.

Solana's rally on pause?
Solana has recently hit a metaphorical ceiling, as the fervor around the DeFi industry and meme coins that once propelled its value upward has begun to decline. This cooling on the NFT market has contributed to the deceleration in SOL's price momentum, as evidenced by the latest price charts.
A close analysis of the SOL price chart indicates a reversal from its upward trajectory, with the asset facing resistance at approximately $101. The resistance level has proven to be a formidable barrier, with Solana struggling to maintain the bullish momentum it had gained in the past.

Support levels for Solana are observed around the $94 and $76 marks. These levels may offer some respite to the asset’s price if the downward pressure continues. If Solana dips to these support levels and holds, it could signal the potential for recovery and another attempt to break through the current resistance.

Despite the recent slowdown, Solana has indeed had an impressive run. Its ecosystem continues to develop, and while the immediate future may not look as bright as it once did, the possibility of a rebound remains. The market’s cyclical nature and the potential for innovation within Solana’s platform could provide the necessary catalyst for another period of growth.

"ChainLink (LINK) Price Explosion: What Happened? Ethereum (ETH) Price Rally Lacks Backbone, Can Bitcoin (BTC) Break Through 50 EMA?","U.Today - Chainlink has surged ahead of the rest of the crypto market with an explosive 16% rally in the last two days. This rally can be attributed to a variety of factors, not least of which is the activity spike in previously dormant wallets, signaling a resurgence of movement within the Chainlink ecosystem.

The analytics have revealed an Age Consumed spike of 5.38 billion, a metric that measures the multiplication of coins moved by the number of days they had remained passive. This sudden mobilization of LINK tokens has injected volatility and liquidity onto the market, fueling the price ascent.

LINK/USDT Chart by TradingViewFrom a technical standpoint, Chainlink's price has breached crucial resistance levels, now attempting to establish new support. The price has soared past the $15.29 mark, which previously acted as a significant resistance barrier. This breakthrough suggests robust bullish sentiment, with the potential for further growth if the momentum is sustained.

The next resistance lies at approximately $18.39, a level that, if conquered, could bolster confidence in Chainlink's uptrend. Conversely, should there be a retracement, the $14.29 level may serve as a new support, providing a safety net for the price. A dip below this could see LINK testing the $13.18 support zone, where buyers may step in to prop up the market.

No power for Ethereum
Ethereum, the second-largest decentralized network by market capitalization, is experiencing a period of stagnation, with its anticipated price rally showing signs of faltering. Despite Ethereum's prominence in the blockchain space, the network is seeing a significant challenge from competitors like Solana, which has been capturing a growing share of blockchain activity.
A closer look at Ethereum's price movement reveals a lack of momentum that could be attributed to the decrease in on-chain traction and volume. Ethereum's price is currently consolidating around the $2,300 mark, struggling to find the strength for a decisive move. The key resistance level to watch is at $2,337, where the token has faced repeated rejections. A breakthrough above this point could potentially lead to a test of the $2,450 zone, offering a glimmer of hope for bullish momentum.

However, the support levels paint a cautious picture, with $2,193 serving as the immediate floor. A breach below this could see prices slide toward the $2,042 level, which could further dampen market sentiment. The lack of volume accompanying recent price movements suggests a tentative market, with investors possibly waiting for a stronger sign of a trend reversal before committing to more substantial positions.

Bitcoin aims for breakthrough
Bitcoin has recently made a bold move, slicing through the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a key technical resistance level. This breakthrough is a sign of strength from the leading cryptocurrency, indicating a potential reversal from its recent price consolidation.
The 50 EMA has historically acted as a litmus test for Bitcoin's short-term trend direction. A sustained move above this line could validate bullish sentiment among investors, as the cryptocurrency tries to establish a new foothold for further gains. Currently, Bitcoin's price is hovering around the $42,000 mark, attempting to solidify its position above the 50 EMA.

In terms of price analysis, the successful breach of the 50 EMA has set the stage for Bitcoin to test the next resistance level near $43,500. This level is critical as a break above could pave the way for a move toward the $45,000 resistance zone. However, it is essential to note that Bitcoin needs to maintain its current momentum to prevent fallbacks below the 50 EMA, which could dampen the optimistic outlook.

Ethereum (ETH) Staking Ratio Surprisingly Keeps Surging Despite Shapella,"U.Today - Ki Young Ju, founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, leading on-chain analytical firm, shared his views on the Ethereum (ETH) staking progress. He admits he was wrong about Shapella hard fork's effects.

Ethereum (ETH) staking ratio surges to 24% and counting
Ethereum (ETH) staking ratio, i.e., the percentage of ETH coins locked in staking, reaches 24% and keeps surging. Meanwhile, only 11% of the ETH supply is stored on centralized exchanges. The data was shared by Ki Young Ju on X today, on Jan. 18, 2024.
As such, it is safe to say that the overhyped Ethereum (ETH) upgrade Shapella that allowed stakers to withdraw their coins for the first time since December 2020 did not result in massive unstaking:

Ethereum's (ETH) Shapella was activated in April 2023. As crypto markets were still dominated by bearish sentiment, analysts were expecting withdrawals and consecutive sell-offs of Ethereum (ETH).

The Ethereum (ETH) price also managed to go through this event without significant losses: as stakers withdrew 1 million Ethers (ETH) in first week post-Shapella, the ETH price was fluctuating between $2,000 and $2,100.

Staked Ethereums (ETH) are mostly profitable, Mr. Ki Young Ju adds. While the realized price for staking inflows is $2,014, the current ETH rate is $2,519. As such, the average Ether ""stake"" is being held with a significant 25% profit.

The aggregated volume of the Ethereum (ETH) staking ecosystem is estimated at a whopping $72 billion, with 4.25% in APY, Staking Rewards data says.

Сardano (ADA) staking close to surpassing Solana (SOL)
At the same time, the largest Ethereum (ETH) competitors might be close to a historic ""flippening."" The Solana (SOL) staking ratio is plummeting. The indicator lost over 20% in the last week and dipped below 67%.
Meanwhile, the Cardano (ADA) staking ecosystem added 0.06% in the last seven days and is getting closer to 64%. At the same time, the USD-denominated volume of Solana (SOL) staking is over 200% larger than that of Cardano (ADA).

Out of all mainstream altcoins, Mina Protocol (MINA) demonstrates the largest staking ratio: its stakers locked over 91% of the circulating supply.

Aptos (APT) and Sui (SUI) follow the Mina Protocol (MINA) with 85%-86% in staking ratio.

He admits he was wrong about Shapella hard fork's effects.

Ethereum (ETH) staking ratio surges to 24% and counting
Ethereum (ETH) staking ratio, i.e., the percentage of ETH coins locked in staking, reaches 24% and keeps surging. Meanwhile, only 11% of the ETH supply is stored on centralized exchanges. The data was shared by Ki Young Ju on X today, on Jan. 18, 2024.
As such, it is safe to say that the overhyped Ethereum (ETH) upgrade Shapella that allowed stakers to withdraw their coins for the first time since December 2020 did not result in massive unstaking:

Ethereum's (ETH) Shapella was activated in April 2023. As crypto markets were still dominated by bearish sentiment, analysts were expecting withdrawals and consecutive sell-offs of Ethereum (ETH).

The Ethereum (ETH) price also managed to go through this event without significant losses: as stakers withdrew 1 million Ethers (ETH) in first week post-Shapella, the ETH price was fluctuating between $2,000 and $2,100.

Staked Ethereums (ETH) are mostly profitable, Mr. Ki Young Ju adds. While the realized price for staking inflows is $2,014, the current ETH rate is $2,519. As such, the average Ether ""stake"" is being held with a significant 25% profit.

The aggregated volume of the Ethereum (ETH) staking ecosystem is estimated at a whopping $72 billion, with 4.25% in APY, Staking Rewards data says.

Сardano (ADA) staking close to surpassing Solana (SOL)
At the same time, the largest Ethereum (ETH) competitors might be close to a historic ""flippening."" The Solana (SOL) staking ratio is plummeting. The indicator lost over 20% in the last week and dipped below 67%.
Meanwhile, the Cardano (ADA) staking ecosystem added 0.06% in the last seven days and is getting closer to 64%. At the same time, the USD-denominated volume of Solana (SOL) staking is over 200% larger than that of Cardano (ADA).

Out of all mainstream altcoins, Mina Protocol (MINA) demonstrates the largest staking ratio: its stakers locked over 91% of the circulating supply.

Aptos (APT) and Sui (SUI) follow the Mina Protocol (MINA) with 85%-86% in staking ratio.

"Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin Makes Surprising Visit to Binance, SHIB Rep Shares Shibarium's Plans to Onboard Thousands of Projects: Crypto News Digest by U.Today","U.Today - Take a look at the most important crypto events with U.Today's top three news stories.

Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin makes surprising visit to Binance
As has been recently shared by Binance CEO Richard Teng on the X platform, Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin made a surprising visit to the Binance office. Teng thanked Buterin for finding time to speak to his team in person, saying that it was a privilege to have him in the company's office. This spontaneous visit caused quite a stir in the crypto community, with many users speculating about a potential collaboration between these two giants of the crypto market. As a reminder, Binance is currently struggling with a $4 billion fine and ongoing regulatory challenges; considering this, Buterin's focus (described in his essay entitled ""Make Ethereum Cypherpunk Again"") on security, privacy and scalability, and concern for centralized exchanges and their vulnerability to hacking, feed rumors about possible cooperation between Buterin and Binance. However, neither Buterin nor Teng made any statements in this regard.
Shibarium: Thousands of projects to join L2 network with numerous partnerships – SHIB rep
In a recent X post, Shiba Inu team member Lucie shared Shibarium's plans for the future. Lucie wrote that the layer-2 solution aims to ""onboard 1,000 projects with numerous partnerships,"" reminding the community that supporting new projects does not necessarily mean canceling existing ones. The SHIB representative then called on all meme token supporters to stay strong as a community during challenging times, stating that there is hardly any point in giving up now if they got ""this far"" in their support for the project's team. Lucie's post has evoked mixed reactions among SHIB army members; even though many of them praised the SHIB developers, some users questioned the project team's ability to accomplish anything more than just making plans and promising new advances.
JPMorgan: Bitcoin ETF hype cooling
According to Kenneth Worthington, analyst at JPMorgan, the initial enthusiasm surrounding Bitcoin ETFs may be waning, with a shift toward a ""more normalized flow environment"" being potentially on the horizon. On Jan. 26, spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced net sales of about $15 million following a four-day streak of redemptions. This reversal could be an indication of changing investor sentiment on these novel financial products. Since their launch, the Bitcoin price has plunged by about 9% but has since stabilized around $42,000 as the new trading week gets underway. Previously, JPMorgan correctly predicted that the approval of Bitcoin ETFs would be a sell-the-news event. Before the approval, the price of the leading cryptocurrency dropped from above $47,000 to below $39,000. The sell-off coincided with large outflows from Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which transitioned into a spot Bitcoin ETF after the SEC's approval.

"Here's Who Burned 9,001 ETH in Last 30 Days","U.Today - Uniswap, the world’s largest decentralized exchange, is apparently a top burner of Ethereum, with a staggering 9,001 ETH incinerated from the circulating supply in the last 30 days. This activity firmly positions Uniswap as a key player in the Ethereum ecosystem, not just in terms of volume but also in influencing the coin's scarcity.

The mechanism behind Ethereum's burn is a recent upgrade known as EIP-1559, which introduced a transaction fee burn for every operation made on the network. Uniswap, as the leading DEX, handles a massive volume of transactions, naturally leading to a higher rate of ETH being burned. This burn acts as a deflationary force on the supply of Ethereum, theoretically creating scarcity that could bolster the asset's value over the long term.

ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewHowever, the correlation between burn rate and immediate price action is not linear. While Uniswap's significant contribution to the burn rate underscores its dominance, the short-term impact on Ethereum’s price is subdued. Over a longer horizon, this deflationary mechanism is expected to establish a supportive base for the price of ETH, as reducing supply, ceteris paribus, should increase the value of each remaining ETH.

It is important to note, though, that scarcity alone does not guarantee value growth. The intrinsic value of Ethereum also hinges on its utility, adoption and broader market sentiment. Currently, Ethereum is facing stiff competition from Solana in ecosystem growth, with many traders who favor volatility and risk gravitating toward Solana.

A technical analysis of Ethereum's current price action shows a challenging market phase. Ethereum is attempting to hold support around the $2,400 level. Should it fail to sustain this, the next key support is observed at the $2,300 mark, near the 50-day EMA. A breach below this could see Ethereum test the $2,000 psychological support level. Conversely, if Ethereum can rally past the immediate resistance at $2,500, it could pave the way to retest previous highs near $2,800.

Vitalik Buterin Answers Major Bitcoin and Ethereum Question in Birthday Essay,"U.Today - Renowned Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin celebrated his 30 birthday today by releasing a thoughtful essay titled ""The End of My Childhood."" The essay delves into the genesis of cryptocurrencies, and Bitcoin in particular, underscoring its initial purpose as a response to the vulnerabilities of traditional banking systems.

In his reflective piece, Buterin questions the evolution of public discourse within the crypto space over the past 15 years, pondering whether the original narrative emphasizing financial disruption has waned. To address this, he proposes two pragmatic approaches for the crypto ecosystem.

First, Buterin advocates for a renewed emphasis on the significance of money and finance, urging the crypto space to actively contribute to serving underserved populations and fostering financial inclusion. Second, he envisions a broader role for crypto that extends beyond finance.

Highlighting the unique decentralized nature of the crypto industry, Buterin notes that developers are dispersed globally, and many major crypto projects are not bound by geographical constraints. He emphasizes the potential of non-Western developers to understand and address the concrete needs of users in low-income countries.

Ideal reality by Vitalik Buterin
Buterin's vision for Ethereum goes beyond financial applications. He envisions ETH as the foundation for a decentralized tech stack, emphasizing trustworthiness, democracy and privacy. Zero-knowledge proofs are identified as a key innovation in achieving these goals, offering a nuanced approach to issues of authenticity, manipulation and privacy.

Ethereum (ETH) Needs These 3 Crucial Factors to Align for Growth: Details,"U.Today - Despite Ethereum's position as a frontrunner in the altcoin sector, its growth has been stunted by a bearish trend that has held a tight grip on the market in recent weeks. A closer look at the ETH chart reveals that the expected volatility spike that could catalyze a bullish reversal has yet to materialize.

Layer-2 network adoption and ecosystem expansion
First, the surge of layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism could be a catalyst for Ethereum's growth. These networks aim to enhance Ethereum's ecosystem by providing the much-needed scalability and reduced fees, potentially driving renewed interest and increased adoption of the Ethereum network.
ETH/USD Chart by TradingView

Scalability and network efficiency
Second, Ethereum's persistent scalability issues must be addressed. Despite the implementation of EIP-1559, which was anticipated to make transaction fees more predictable, the network still struggles under high demand, leading to exorbitant fees and reduced network functionality. Resolving these scalability woes is crucial, as a more efficient and cost-effective network is vital for Ethereum to retain its value and utility.
Introduction of Ethereum ETF
Finally, the establishment of an Ethereum ETF would be a strong bullish signal, mirroring the impact of the Bitcoin ETF. An Ethereum ETF would pave the way for institutional investment, providing a regulated and accessible means for traditional investors to gain exposure to ETH. This could secure Ethereum's future as a mainstream financial asset and provide a stable foundation for long-term growth.
Looking at the Ethereum chart, we identify a local resistance level at approximately $2433.5, a price point that has acted as a hurdle in recent trading sessions. For a bullish case to solidify, Ethereum needs to break past this resistance with conviction. Should this occur, it could signal a shift in investor sentiment and open the path to higher price levels.

Self-Proclaimed Satoshi Craig Wright Takes Dig at Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin,"U.Today - In an unexpected turn of events today, self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto Craig Wright took a swipe at Ethereum's creator, Vitalik Buterin. Wright revisited a series of posts by Buterin in 2017, where he discussed the early versions of the Ethereum protocol.

Back then, Buterin had responded to a question about the possibility of building Ethereum on top of Bitcoin, expressing concerns about potential conflicts with Bitcoin's development team. He cited fears that protocol rules might change, making it difficult for him to build on a base protocol at odds with his vision.

Fast forward to January 2024, and Wright seized the opportunity to comment on Buterin's past remarks. He argued that Ethereum only exists due to centralized development teams that have the power to alter the protocol. Wright mused about the hypothetical scenario of having everything built on Bitcoin, envisioning a more streamlined and less fragmented system.

Bitcoin v. Ethereum
Wright's comments add fuel to the longstanding rivalry between Bitcoin and Ethereum, highlighting fundamental differences in their approaches to decentralization and protocol governance.
While Ethereum has achieved considerable success as a platform for smart contracts and applications, Wright argues for the stability and originality of Bitcoin's protocol.

Moreover, it revives the centralization debate in both cryptocurrency ecosystems. On the one side is OFAC's censorship of ETH transactions; on the other side is the enormous concentration of BTC in the hands of whales and miners.

"Samson Mow Takes Subtle Jab at Ethereum (ETH), Is XRP Next?","U.Today - Samson Mow, the chief executive officer of investment firm Jan3 and prominent Bitcoin (BTC) bull and evangelist, has taken his advocacy for the top coin to a new level. In his latest post on X, he took a subtle jab at alternative investment assets, including Silver and Ethereum (ETH), as his way of reducing their viability in comparison to their counterparts Gold and Silver.

Samson Mow analogy
According to Samson Mow, Silver is the poor man’s Gold, a statement that shows that investors who consider the latter to be too expensive typically opt in for the former. While both are respected metals and investment assets, Gold is still considered the superior of the two.
Samson Mow deflated Ethereum’s ego to end the long-standing superiority debate with Bitcoin. The vocal investor noted that ""Ethereum is the stupid man's Bitcoin,"" a statement that spooked members of the ETH community.

By valuation, Bitcoin’s market cap currently stands at $809,923,408,001, while that of Ethereum comes in at $297,575,053,741. The price differentials of $41,344.01 to $2,476.66 also show that Bitcoin is the most valuable of the two. Over time, there have been conversations about shifting capital from BTC to ETH, a trend that might be amplified in the coming months if Ethereum’s key fundamentals come into play.

The harsh criticism of Ethereum did not go down well with its community members, with some pointing out the key improvements the protocol has made as a blockchain in itself.

Is XRP next?
As a Bitcoin Maxi, Samson Mow was asked by one of the commenters on his post what he thinks about XRP if Ethereum is the poor man’s Bitcoin. He simply answered that the demand is a ""tricky one.""
Samson Mow’s confidence in Bitcoin has made him forecast a $1 million price target, and his lack of confidence in XRP and Ethereum has undoubtedly made his bearish stand subtle.

Ethereum (ETH) Faces Serious Bug; Here's Who Might Be Affected,"U.Today - Ethereum is potentially facing a significant bug that has emerged, previously only assumed as a hypothetical scenario in discussions among the developer and validator community back in March 2022, but now it looms as a potential threat that could become a reality.

This bug concerns the Ethereum staking mechanism and how the network reaches consensus. In essence, if a majority client, holding more than 2/3 of the stake, has a bug, it could inadvertently build an invalid chain that the network would consider finalized due to the majority stake's ""agreement.""

If validators running this buggy client commit to this incorrect chain, any attempt to switch to a correct chain could result in severe penalties due to how the Ethereum protocol is designed to penalize what it sees as ""equivocating"" validators.

What makes this situation particularly alarming is the scale of the potential impact. If this bug manifests, the validators could find themselves in a predicament where they either continue to support an incorrect chain or switch to a correct one at great personal cost. The validators running the buggy client would face a dilemma: lose their stake through penalties or persist with an invalid chain, endangering the network's integrity.

For the average Ethereum holder not involved in staking or blockchain development, this might seem distant, but the implications can be far-reaching. An individual commented that the situation is ""pretty scary,"" and it is also the main reason why they do not stake any ETH. This sentiment reflects a potentially surging concern among holders who fear the ripple effects a bug of this magnitude could have on the network's trust and stability.

Centralized exchanges (CEXes), although well capitalized, might also feel the effect of potential finalization issues. Though their liquidity is far more resilient, mitigating large losses might still become an issue.

"Ethereum Whale Moves $46 Million in ETH Across Binance, Bitfinex and Aave: Details","U.Today - In a surprising move that has captured the attention of the cryptocurrency community, an Ethereum (ETH) whale has orchestrated a series of transactions involving major exchanges, moving a staggering $46.02 million in ETH over the past two days. The entity, utilizing a network of eight wallets, withdrew funds from Binance and Bitfinex before staking with Lido, a liquid staking solution.

Blockchain analytics platform Spot On Chain first brought attention to the substantial transactions through a tweet, revealing intricate details of the massive ETH movement. The whale withdrew the Ethereum holdings from crypto exchanges Binance and Bitfinex at an average price of approximately $2,419.

Subsequently, five wallets were employed to withdraw 50.15 million USDT from Aave, a prominent DeFi protocol, to the CEX trading platform, exchanging the stablecoin for 19,021 ETH, equivalent to the $46.02 million value. Spot On Chain further disclosed that three wallets still retained around 30 million USDT in Aave, sparking speculation that they might deposit these funds into a CEX soon, potentially acquiring more ETH.

Ethereum price struggles
The timing of these transactions coincided with a challenging period for the Ethereum market. At the time of the whale's activity, the price of ETH struggled, recording a 4.57% dip in the last 24 hours and a 9.46% decline in the past week. Current market data indicates ETH trading at $2,296.
Coinglass, another analytics platform, reported a significant amount of liquidations for ETH within the last 24 hours, totaling $53.78 million. Of this amount, $47.48 million resulted from long liquidations, while short liquidations accounted for $6.29 million. The liquidation data underscores the volatility and uncertainty prevalent on the market, with traders experiencing significant losses.

Market analysts and enthusiasts are closely monitoring these developments, as such large-scale transactions from influential entities often lead to speculation and conjecture regarding potential market impacts. Traders and investors are advised to exercise caution and stay vigilant as the cryptocurrency landscape continues to unfold, revealing the dynamics of this rapidly evolving market.

Ethereum (ETH) Becomes Target of Massive $1 Billion Sell-Off: Who's Responsible?,"U.Today - Ethereum is encountering a massive sell-off exceeding $1 billion. The source of this enormous market movement can be traced back to Celsius, which reportedly transferred a staggering 459,561 ETH, valued at approximately $1.014 billion, to various exchanges.

The distribution of this sell-off was as follows: 297,454 ETH ($656.5 million) moved to Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) Prime, 146,507 ETH to Paxos Treasury and smaller amounts of 7,800 ETH each, totaling $17.2 million, were transferred to FalconX and Coinbase. Despite this massive transfer, Celsius reportedly retains a reserve of 62,468 ETH, worth around $139 million.

Such a colossal sale exerts immense pressure on Ethereum's price and could significantly sway market sentiment. The immediate concern for investors and traders is whether Ethereum's liquidity and market capitalization can absorb such a hit without triggering a broad market downturn.

From a technical analysis standpoint, the massive outflow from Celsius is a bearish signal, likely to test Ethereum's local support levels. A crucial support to watch is around the $2,000 price range, a psychological and technical support level, which, if breached, could see the price tumble to the next significant support at $1,800. This level has historically acted as a strong buy zone and may serve as a robust defense against further declines.

Conversely, resistance levels have become more formidable due to the sell-off. Any potential recovery will have to confront the resistance at $2,200, which previously acted as a support level. A break above this could see Ethereum attempt to reclaim higher price levels, possibly testing the $2,400 resistance.

The substantial sell-off initiated by Celsius has placed Ethereum in a problematic position. Although the Ethereum network's fundamentals remain robust, the asset's price resilience in the face of such a significant sell-off shows the actual state of the market.

$13 Milion in Ethereum (ETH) Destroyed as Supply Becomes Deflationary Again,"U.Today - The recent data from Ethereum network indicates that the supply of Ethereum has once again entered a deflationary phase. Over the past 30 days, a striking $13 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) has been destroyed, with the net supply change showing a decrease of 5,619.39 ETH. This deflationary pressure is due to the network's burning mechanism, which has incinerated 74,933.24 ETH, outstripping the 69,313.86 ETH issued in the same period.

The implications of this deflationary trend could signal an approaching rally for Ethereum. A deflationary supply inherently suggests that the available quantity of ETH is decreasing, which could lead to an increase in value per token, assuming demand stays the same or grows. This dynamic, combined with the Ethereum network's continuous development and adoption, may set the stage for a bullish scenario.

ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewAnalyzing the Ethereum chart, a crucial factor is the potential breakthrough of the 50-day Exponential Moving Average. Currently, Ethereum hovers just below this significant level, and a break above could confirm a shift in market sentiment, potentially igniting upward price movement.

However, it is essential to acknowledge that Ethereum's current market traction is relatively muted. Despite the burn and the deflationary state of supply, the lack of significant network activity or groundbreaking updates has kept the token from gaining substantial momentum. Even activities by Ethereum's cofounder, Vitalik Buterin, which have historically influenced the market, seem to provide only a moderate push at best, under current conditions.

The market awaits a catalyst that could reignite Ethereum's dominance in the blockchain space. While the reduction in supply is a positive sign, without an accompanying increase in demand or network utility, the impact on price may be limited.

Ethereum Closer to Epic Rebranding as Sepolia Welcomes Dencun Upgrade,"U.Today - The Ethereum blockchain is on its way to a massive rebranding as its long-awaited Dencun upgrade is now live on the Sepolia testnet. The Ethereum Foundation projected that the Dencun upgrade would launch on Sepolia by Jan. 30, and the successful integration was revealed by core developer Terrence.eth, for which he received many accolades from the community.

The Dencun upgrade going live on Sepolia is one of the two remaining steps required to launch the update on the Ethereum mainnet. Ethereum has long been plagued with lower scalability and high gas fees. For this, it has continued to receive intense backlash from industry analysts like legendary trader Peter Brandt, who considers its high cost of operation a basis for its demise in the long term.

The Dencun upgrade will attempt to resolve scalability issues while also making Ethereum more cost-effective as a protocol. The Dencun upgrade will specifically introduce proto-danksharding, a compressed data storage mechanism dubbed ""blobs"" to help optimize performance.

Development efforts are now in their advanced stages as the upgrade was launched on the Goerli testnet earlier this month. The last step before the mainnet debut will be to launch on the Holesky testnet, an upgrade that is scheduled for Feb. 7.

Ethereum to fight back against its competitors
Many new protocols have emerged to capitalize on the weakness of the Ethereum protocol. From Solana (SOL) to Cardano (ADA) and even Avalanche (AVAX), the race to dethrone Ethereum remains the core mantra for many developers in the Web3 ecosystem today.
With the Dencun upgrade, many of the pain points on Ethereum can be resolved, thus making the protocol more attractive to developers and end users overall. With the upgrade, Ethereum is poised to extend its dominance as the top blockchain of choice for all things decentralized finance (DeFi) and more.

Major FED Decision to Affect Crypto Market in Two Days,"U.Today - The crypto market is bracing itself as the Federal Reserve gears up to announce its first interest rate decision of 2024. The whispers from the CME about a 96.9% chance to keep interest rates unchanged are causing ripples. Yet, with the second decision in March casting a 47% shadow of a rate cut by 25 basis points (bps), investors are on edge. Adding to the economic fervor, the United States is set to release the January unemployment rate, which could further sway market sentiment.

The Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates is a critical economic lever that traditionally influences traditional markets and, as has been seen, the cryptocurrency market as well. An unchanged interest rate could maintain the status quo, possibly keeping investment steady in assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

A cut, however, could signal economic caution, potentially reducing the attractiveness of risk assets like cryptocurrencies or, conversely, could lead investors to seek higher returns in the crypto market if traditional investments falter.

BTC/USD Chart by TradingViewAnalyzing the Bitcoin chart, there is a distinctive ""war"" between the bulls and bears. The immediate resistance level to watch is around the $42,500 mark, which Bitcoin has been testing recently. This level is crucial because a decisive close above it could signal increasing bullish momentum. On the downside, the support level at approximately $39,528, aligning with a psychological round number and a previous area of interest, is one that traders are likely to defend vigorously.

The upcoming Fed decision could serve as a catalyst for Bitcoin's next big move. If interest rates remain unchanged, Bitcoin could continue to test the resistance level, and a break above could confirm a bullish reversal. However, should rates decrease, Bitcoin's reaction might be even more unpredictable.

Another Dormant Ethereum Whale With Pre-Mined ETH Suddenly Wakes Up,"U.Today - In a remarkable development within the cryptocurrency sphere, an inactive Ethereum whale, dormant for eight and a half years, has reemerged into the scene by transferring a significant 100 ETH, translating to a substantial $230,159. Etherscan data reveals that this address, dormant since its genesis block in July 2015, has stirred curiosity as it displays activity for the first time.

The awakening saw the whale execute transfers, sending 20 ETH to one undisclosed address and 77 ETH to another, both shrouded in mystery. This resurgence aligns with a recent trend, as another dormant Ethereum address, containing 492 ETH valued at $1.14 million, was activated after a prolonged dormancy since its genesis event, as reported by U.Today last Friday.

"Shiba Inu (SHIB) Rapidly Breaks Down, Ethereum (ETH) Loses Traction, While Solana (SOL) Presents Hidden Opportunity","U.Today - Shiba Inu has experienced a significant breakdown from its recent consolidation phase. The chart depicts a clear downward trajectory as SHIB failed to maintain its position within the ascending triangle pattern it had formed over the past few months.

The breakdown was signaled as SHIB prices breached the key support level at $0.000009, which had previously acted as a reliable floor for the price during consolidation phases. Following this, SHIB prices tumbled further, slicing through subsequent support near $0.0000087. This price action marked a decisive shift in market sentiment from accumulation to distribution.

SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewThe next support level to watch is at $0.0000082, where SHIB may find a temporary reprieve from the selling pressure. If this level fails to hold, the next critical support lies at $0.0000076, which could serve as the last line of defense before a more significant drop.

For a reversal to occur and for SHIB to regain its upward momentum, it would need to reclaim previous support levels and transform them back into supports. This would require a substantial influx of buying pressure, potentially sparked by positive developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem or broader cryptocurrency market rallies.

The first sign of a possible reversal would be a return above $0.0000087, followed by a sustained move above the $0.000009 price level. A breakout above these levels, accompanied by increasing volume, could indicate that the downtrend is losing steam and that bulls are regaining control.

Solana paints reversal pattern
Solana has been developing a subtle yet potentially pivotal chart pattern. The asset has been tracing a slow and steady ascending channel, a formation that suggests a controlled and consistent uptrend. This pattern, characterized by higher lows and higher highs contained within two parallel trendlines, speaks to potential for continued growth.
The significance of this pattern lies in the momentum it could provide for SOL. Should the price action remain strong within the upper half of the channel, and particularly if it challenges the upper trendline, we could see Solana break through and embark on a more aggressive rally.

Such a bullish scenario would likely be supported by increased trading volume and positive developments within the Solana ecosystem, such as new project launches or updates that enhance network performance.

The immediate local resistance stands at around $55, and a confident push beyond this could confirm bullish sentiment. Inversely, if Solana's price dips below the channel's lower boundary, around $48, it could indicate that a bearish narrative is taking hold.

Ethereum momentum decreasing
Ethereum is exhibiting signs of waning momentum, as observed in recent price movements. The asset, which has long been considered the backbone of the decentralized finance sector, is facing a pivotal moment that could determine its trajectory for the coming weeks.
The provided chart illustrates Ethereum's struggle to maintain its grasp on the market. The price has been on a downward trend, edging closer to the local 26-day Exponential Moving Average. This level, currently near $2,465, is critical; if Ethereum fails to hold this line, we might see it descend to test the more significant 50 EMA, which stands around the $2,300 mark.

The 26 EMA serves as a short-term sentiment gauge, and its breach could signal a lack of immediate bullish support. Should this level fail to act as a springboard for price recovery, Ethereum's next stop could indeed be the 50 EMA. A breach below this longer-term moving average could potentially open the gates for a test of lower support levels, highlighting the need for investors to brace for more volatility.

Market participants are now recalibrating their expectations, understanding that the road to sustainable gains is a long-term journey.

This would require a substantial influx of buying pressure, potentially sparked by positive developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem or broader cryptocurrency market rallies.

The first sign of a possible reversal would be a return above $0.0000087, followed by a sustained move above the $0.000009 price level. A breakout above these levels, accompanied by increasing volume, could indicate that the downtrend is losing steam and that bulls are regaining control.

Solana paints reversal pattern
Solana has been developing a subtle yet potentially pivotal chart pattern. The asset has been tracing a slow and steady ascending channel, a formation that suggests a controlled and consistent uptrend. This pattern, characterized by higher lows and higher highs contained within two parallel trendlines, speaks to potential for continued growth.
The significance of this pattern lies in the momentum it could provide for SOL. Should the price action remain strong within the upper half of the channel, and particularly if it challenges the upper trendline, we could see Solana break through and embark on a more aggressive rally.

Such a bullish scenario would likely be supported by increased trading volume and positive developments within the Solana ecosystem, such as new project launches or updates that enhance network performance.

The immediate local resistance stands at around $55, and a confident push beyond this could confirm bullish sentiment. Inversely, if Solana's price dips below the channel's lower boundary, around $48, it could indicate that a bearish narrative is taking hold.

Ethereum momentum decreasing
Ethereum is exhibiting signs of waning momentum, as observed in recent price movements. The asset, which has long been considered the backbone of the decentralized finance sector, is facing a pivotal moment that could determine its trajectory for the coming weeks.
The provided chart illustrates Ethereum's struggle to maintain its grasp on the market. The price has been on a downward trend, edging closer to the local 26-day Exponential Moving Average. This level, currently near $2,465, is critical; if Ethereum fails to hold this line, we might see it descend to test the more significant 50 EMA, which stands around the $2,300 mark.

The 26 EMA serves as a short-term sentiment gauge, and its breach could signal a lack of immediate bullish support. Should this level fail to act as a springboard for price recovery, Ethereum's next stop could indeed be the 50 EMA. A breach below this longer-term moving average could potentially open the gates for a test of lower support levels, highlighting the need for investors to brace for more volatility.

Market participants are now recalibrating their expectations, understanding that the road to sustainable gains is a long-term journey.

"XRP's Epic Battle Against Bears, Solana Breaks $100, While Ethereum Fights for Momentum","U.Today - XRP is currently locked in a fierce struggle with bearish forces. The digital asset, which operates within the Ripple network, is experiencing difficulty establishing a position above a critical technical indicator — the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).

The 200 EMA serves as an important barometer for the long-term trend and investor sentiment. For XRP, remaining below this level suggests that the asset lacks the bullish momentum needed to shift into an upward trajectory. This inability to secure a foothold above the 200 EMA raises questions about the stability of positive price action in the near term.

XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewTechnical analysis shows that the 200 EMA is a dynamic level of resistance that many traders watch closely. A consistent failure to breach this mark can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy where the resistance level grows stronger, as more traders set their sell orders around this key price point.

Ethereum keeps on struggling
Ethereum is showing signs of losing its upward momentum, failing to form a higher high — an indicator that market experts often interpret as a sign of an impending price correction.
The ETH chart reveals a telling pattern; the absence of a new higher high is significant. Typically, in a bullish market phase, the price of an asset creates a series of higher highs and higher lows. However, Ethereum's inability to push beyond its recent peak may suggest that the bulls are running out of steam and a reevaluation of market sentiment could be underway.

Analyzing the chart, the local resistance level has been a tough ceiling for Ethereum to break. This resistance, where sell orders tend to cluster, is acting as a barrier preventing further upward movement. On the flip side, the support level represents a price point with a concentration of buy orders, offering a potential cushion against a price drop. If Ethereum fails to uphold the support level, it could trigger a price breakdown, signaling a shift to a bearish trend.

If Ethereum's price continues to struggle, the scenario could unfold where the asset drops further, testing subsequent support levels. While the underlying fundamentals of Ethereum, such as network upgrades and adoption rates, remain robust, the short-term price action could still be subject to corrective forces.

Solana wants another round
The battleground of volatility on the crypto market continues, and Solana (SOL) has not been spared from its whims. Once a darling of the crypto world for its speed and efficiency, SOL has recently been up against a wall, struggling to surpass the crucial $100 mark. The price chart reflects a narrative of struggle and resistance, painting a picture of an asset in need of momentum.
The technical outlook for SOL is looking promising. After a period of bullish activity that piqued the interest of many investors, SOL has hit a snag near the $100 resistance level. This resistance level represents a significant psychological and financial barrier, as it is where sell orders tend to accumulate, putting downward pressure on the price.

Despite efforts to rally, the asset has been unable to generate the necessary momentum to overcome this threshold with ease and currently consolidates at it. One of the key factors influencing this lackluster performance could be the market's tepid reaction to the announcement of Solana phone Saga 2. The news, which might have been expected to inject some enthusiasm onto the market, failed to provide substantial support for Solana's price.

Looking at the chart, the local support levels are clearly delineated. The first line of defense for SOL lies around the $88-$90 price range, where previous dips have found buyers waiting. Should this level fail to hold, the next support may not emerge until it reaches the more robust $70 level, which could act as a stronger foothold for the price.

Conversely, resistance beyond $100 is now more formidable than ever. With each rejection, the resolve of buyers weakens, and the $100 level transforms from a mere price point into a crucial psychological level you should not miss.

"XRP Is Surprisingly Stable, Here's Why","U.Today - XRP is currently holding above the crucial 200-day EMA, a level that has morphed into a dynamic support line. This pivotal line, sitting approximately at $0.55, is now the battleground where XRP's short-term destiny is being contested.

In recent days, XRP's price action has been characterized by its struggle to overcome a series of local resistance levels. A notable rejection was faced around the $0.63 mark, which has added to the narrative of an asset under pressure. Despite these rejections, the asset's ability to stay afloat above the 200-day EMA suggests underlying strength and potential for growth.

XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewThe market's oppressiveness toward XRP can be attributed to various factors, including lack of usecase for XRP and a poor performance throughout the 2023. However, the past has shown that XRP can swiftly shift from oppressed states to strong bullish rallies, often catching many off-guard.

For a scenario where XRP's growth continues, it is essential for the token to maintain its stand above the 200-day EMA. If this level holds, it can serve as a springboard for future bullish attempts. A decisive close above this moving average could stimulate investor confidence, potentially leading to a challenge of the recent resistance at $0.63. A break and hold above this level could signal a trend reversal and may pave the way for XRP to target higher resistances, possibly around the $0.70 to $0.75 regions.

Solana is back in uptrend
Solana is showing signs of entering an uptrend once more. The recent price chart reveals a pattern of resilience, with Solana forming a higher low that indicates a potential shift in market sentiment.
After dipping to a support level around $88 on December 20, 2023, Solana has rebounded, forming a higher low near the $90 mark. This movement suggests accumulating strength and a possible change in direction from the previous downward trend. The local trendline resistance, which Solana is currently testing, is evident at approximately $97.50.

Two pivotal price levels stand out on Solana's chart. The first resistance level after the trendline sits near the $100 psychological mark. This round number has historically been a challenging point for Solana to breach decisively. Beyond that, the $104 level looms as the next significant barrier, which was a previous local high around January 3, 2024.

Conversely, on the support side, the level to watch is around $88, as mentioned earlier. This price has proven to be a firm foundation, with buyers stepping in to uphold Solana's valuation. A secondary support level is present near $85, just below the 50-day moving average, acting as a safety net for any potential retracements.

Ethereum's dominance prevails
Ethereum swiftly cuts through resistance levels with a bullish fervor that has not been seen in recent times. After a spirited 8.8% pump, Ethereum has confidently surpassed the $2,500 and $2,600 milestones, setting its sights firmly on the next major resistance level at $3,000.
The rapid growth witnessed in the past few days has been nothing short of impressive. Ethereum, which lingered around the $2,400 mark in the early days of February, has seen a significant influx of buying pressure, leading to a breakthrough past key resistance levels. This positive price action posits two potential scenarios for the smart contract giant.

In one scenario, Ethereum could continue its aggressive push, riding the wave of current market optimism towards the $3,000 target. If this momentum is maintained, and with the additional fuel from the recent high volume of trades, ETH could test $3,000 in the coming days. A consolidation above $2,600 would be crucial for this scenario to unfold, as it would establish a new support level, reinforcing investor confidence.

Alternatively, given the volatile nature of the crypto markets, a retracement could occur before Ethereum reaches $3,000. This would likely see the asset retesting support at the $2,500 level, which if held, could serve as a springboard for a second wave towards and beyond $3,000.

"Shiba Inu (SHIB) Becoming Bullish, Ethereum (ETH) Price Screams Rally Continuation, Bitcoin (BTC) Not Giving up Market Dominance","U.Today - Shiba Inu currently displays an ascending triangle pattern on the SHIB/USDT chart. This technical formation is widely recognized and could be a signal to a significant price surge for the meme.

An ascending triangle is characterized by a flat upper resistance line and a rising lower support line. This pattern suggests that buyers are gradually gaining ground against sellers, as each dip is bought up at a higher level than the previous one, indicating accumulating pressure for an upward breakout.

SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewFor Shiba Inu, which has been lingering in a period of relatively nonexistent activity, this pattern could serve as massive fuel for volatility in the near future. Recent market conditions have seen a decline in interest toward legacy meme coins, with SHIB being no exception. The lack of significant developments within the Shiba Inu network has contributed to the muted activity around this cryptocurrency.

In contrast, the majority of the action in the meme coin sector has been taking place on the Solana network. This platform has become a hotbed for the deployment of new meme coins, which are exhibiting far greater volatility than those on the Ethereum network, where Shiba Inu resides. The brisk activity on Solana contrasts sharply with the sluggishness observed in Ethereum's meme coin space, drawing in traders and investors looking for quick gains and high excitement.

Ethereum's correction is temporary
The Ethereum market is currently exhibiting a correction, and there are patterns that suggest a rally may not only be on the horizon but could also be in continuation. The asset has recently experienced a sharp downturn, movement that is readily apparent on intraday timeframes. However, such stark movements are often precursors to reversals, signaling that Ethereum could be gearing up for an upswing.
A closer look at the charts shows Ethereum's price action respecting a series of key technical indicators which, together, build a case for potential upward momentum. The asset has been tracing back to touch base with its moving averages, a behavior that is typically followed by a rebound, as these levels can act as dynamic support zones.

This corrective phase is noteworthy, especially considering the robust rally Ethereum enjoyed in the preceding weeks. Corrections are a natural and healthy part of any asset's price trajectory, allowing for consolidation before the next leg up. For Ethereum, the current pullback could be shaking out weak hands, setting the stage for a stronger rally propelled by a more committed investor base.

Bitcoin's dominance not going anywhere
After a brief breach below the 50-day EMA — a critical indicator of medium-term market sentiment — Bitcoin has clawed its way back above this pivotal level. This move indicates a bullish signal for market observers, suggesting that Bitcoin is not yet ready to relinquish its market dominance.
However, the ascent above the 50 EMA has not been met with the kind of vigorous momentum that bulls would hope for. The growth has been moderate, hinting that Bitcoin might encounter selling pressure as it ascends. This is not unusual on the crypto markets, where significant moves often face immediate resistance as traders take profits and skeptics cast doubts.

The recent price action has been a roller coaster for Bitcoin, which saw its value tumble from highs around $47,000 to lows near $41,000. This downturn briefly shifted the spotlight to altcoins, which seized the moment to stage local rallies. The diversification of gains across the crypto spectrum during Bitcoin's periods of weakness is a trend that has become more pronounced as the overall market matures.

Yet Bitcoin's ability to push back above the 50 EMA serves as a reminder of its underlying strength and the confidence investors have placed in it. Despite the opportunity for altcoins to rise, Bitcoin remains the anchor of the crypto market, with its moves often dictating broader market sentiment. This recent rebound above a crucial technical level could be interpreted as Bitcoin's silent assertion that it is not ready to give up the throne just yet.

"Ethereum (ETH) In Dangerous Position, Bitcoin (BTC) About to Lose $40,000, Shiba Inu (SHIB) At Local Support","U.Today - Ethereum finds itself shaky on the edge of a precarious position. The recent price chart indicates a concerning situation: the 26-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a key indicator of short-term momentum, is under threat. If this level fails to hold, Ethereum could see its value dip to the $2,347 mark, a scenario that may well trigger a more pronounced decline.

This potential slip below the 26 EMA is crucial because it suggests a weakening in buying pressure and a shift in market sentiment from accumulation to potential distribution. A break below this level would not only establish $2,347 as the next price floor but could also exacerbate the asset's losses, leading to further bearish momentum.

ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewThe Ethereum ecosystem has faced its share of challenges despite the rise of layer 2-networks, which have not catalyzed the anticipated rally. The broader market has similarly not exhibited the explosive bull run many investors had hoped for, with Ethereum’s trajectory reflecting this subdued market energy.

Additional support and resistance zones can be gleaned from the chart. On the support side, following the $2,347 level, the next critical support lies around $2,175.2 - a breach of which could see ETH test the psychological and technical support near the $2,000 level. Resistance, on the other hand, is firmly established at the recent high of $2,547.6. This price point serves as a litmus test for Ethereum’s ability to rebound and reclaim bullish momentum.

The current market dynamics, marked by cautious trading and a lack of definitive direction, have placed Ethereum in a zone of uncertainty. Investors are advised to monitor these levels closely, as a break below or above these could signal Ethereum's next significant move.

Bitcoin in trouble
Bitcoin finds itself at a precarious juncture as it teeters on the edge of the critical $40,000 mark. The recent price action paints a troubling picture for Bitcoin enthusiasts, with the asset losing its grip on the 50-day Exponential Moving Average, a key support level that has historically indicated bullish sentiment.
As Bitcoin's price struggles to maintain the $40,000 level, the next potential foothold lies at the 100-day EMA. However, this level does not traditionally offer substantial support, and a breach below could precipitate a fall below $39,000, triggering heightened market concern. The chart reveals that the next major support zone stands near the $35,888 mark, a level that buyers might attempt to defend vigorously.

On the resistance front, Bitcoin faces a significant challenge at the $42,786 price level. Overcoming this resistance is crucial for Bitcoin to regain stability and demonstrate potential for a recovery. However, the market currently lacks the necessary liquidity to facilitate a strong rebound, as trading volumes remain relatively low.

Shiba Inu gets hit
The token is currently trading at a local support level, which is a make-or-break situation for its short-term future. A breakdown below this point could spell trouble, signaling a potential decline and testing the resilience of its investor base.
The current market landscape for SHIB is challenging, with a noticeable lack of growth catalysts and low liquidity in the broader cryptocurrency market, both of which could exacerbate the asset's precarious position.

However, there is a glimmer of hope. The descending trading volume accompanying SHIB's price consolidation suggests that bearish momentum could be waning. This deceleration of selling pressure often precedes a stabilization of price, or even a reversal if bulls regain control.

In terms of specific price levels, SHIB is currently finding tentative support around the $0.000027 mark. Should this level fail to hold, the next support zone lies near $0.000022, which may serve as a new accumulation point for buyers. On the resistance side, SHIB faces a hurdle at $0.000035, a breach of which could open the door to a retest of higher levels, possibly around the $0.000040 range.

However, this level does not traditionally offer substantial support, and a breach below could precipitate a fall below $39,000, triggering heightened market concern. The chart reveals that the next major support zone stands near the $35,888 mark, a level that buyers might attempt to defend vigorously.

On the resistance front, Bitcoin faces a significant challenge at the $42,786 price level. Overcoming this resistance is crucial for Bitcoin to regain stability and demonstrate potential for a recovery. However, the market currently lacks the necessary liquidity to facilitate a strong rebound, as trading volumes remain relatively low.

Shiba Inu gets hit
The token is currently trading at a local support level, which is a make-or-break situation for its short-term future. A breakdown below this point could spell trouble, signaling a potential decline and testing the resilience of its investor base.
The current market landscape for SHIB is challenging, with a noticeable lack of growth catalysts and low liquidity in the broader cryptocurrency market, both of which could exacerbate the asset's precarious position.

However, there is a glimmer of hope. The descending trading volume accompanying SHIB's price consolidation suggests that bearish momentum could be waning. This deceleration of selling pressure often precedes a stabilization of price, or even a reversal if bulls regain control.

In terms of specific price levels, SHIB is currently finding tentative support around the $0.000027 mark. Should this level fail to hold, the next support zone lies near $0.000022, which may serve as a new accumulation point for buyers. On the resistance side, SHIB faces a hurdle at $0.000035, a breach of which could open the door to a retest of higher levels, possibly around the $0.000040 range.

"Ethereum (ETH) Loses All of Its Gains, Bitcoin (BTC) Not Ready to Give up $40,000, Solana (SOL) Comeback Starts","U.Today - Ethereum has wiped out the gains it had accumulated over a sustained period. The ETH/USD price chart depicts a grim narrative as the digital asset has swiftly descended from its peak, retracing back to levels that question the sustainability of its prior growth.

The steep decline in Ethereum's price is a significant bearish signal. It reflects the market's hesitancy to invest at previous highs, most likely due to the underperformance Ethereum has shown in the recent past. This lack of traction and inability to initiate a recovery underscores the vulnerability of Ethereum's price in the current market climate.

ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewFocusing on the technical aspects, Ethereum has broken through what was once seen as a strong support level at approximately $2,350. This price point, which previously saw substantial buying interest, has now been breached, leading to a cascading effect as the asset searches for new support. The next critical support level is around $2,175, where buyers might emerge to stall the downfall.

Conversely, any attempts at recovery will first encounter resistance at around $2,338, a level that now marks the lower boundary of what was a consolidation range before the drop. A close above this level on significant volume could signal a temporary respite from selling pressure. However, the real test lies at higher resistance levels, previously established around $2,500, where ETH struggled to maintain upward momentum.

Bitcoin ready to fight
Recent candlestick formations portray a scenario where Bitcoin is flirting with a critical resistance level, poised to either confirm a bearish trend or start a substantial recovery.
The chart illustrates Bitcoin’s recent descent, as it lost its foothold at the higher price echelons it previously occupied. However, amid this downward movement, Bitcoin is showing signs of resilience. The latest candles indicate a potential reversal as they hover around a significant support level, which can be identified at approximately $37,000, a region where buyers have historically stepped in.

A sustained hold above this point could catalyze renewed buying interest, which may drive the price toward the immediate resistance level at around $41,000. The significance of reclaiming this threshold cannot be understated, as it may invalidate the bearish outlook and signal a trend reversal.

As for the upper resistances, the $43,000 and $46,000 price levels stand out as notable barriers that Bitcoin would need to breach to cement a robust recovery narrative. Achieving such milestones could sway market sentiment positively, potentially ushering in a wave of optimism among investors.

The moving averages offer additional insight, suggesting a possible bullish crossover should the current momentum persist. This scenario would be further supported by a rise in trading volume, which typically accompanies decisive trend shifts.

Solana among leaders
Solana shows signs of a nascent comeback, presenting a bullish scenario amid a broader market recovery. However, investors tread cautiously, aware of the potential of a ""dead cat bounce"" since volume profiles signal restraint.
Analyzing the SOL/USDT chart, we notice that Solana has established a local support level around the $70 price mark. This is characterized by multiple touches of this level over the past few weeks, each time resisting further downward movement.

On the flip side, the local resistance can be identified near the $96 level, which previously acted as support during Solana's consistent upward trend.

The price movement is currently sandwiched between the 50-day moving average acting as dynamic resistance and the 200-day moving average serving as potential dynamic support. The narrowing gap between these averages could squeeze the price action, possibly leading to a volatility breakout.

"XRP Starts Moving Earlier, Solana (SOL) Already Stronger Than Everyone Else; Does Ethereum (ETH) Need More Fuel?","U.Today - XRP appears to have begun its market movements earlier than anticipated. The chart shows a notable shift from the recent sideways trading pattern, as XRP starts to carve out a new direction.

As of the latest trends, XRP has been testing the support level around $0.50, a crucial psychological threshold for the asset. A sustained move below this level could signal further bearish momentum, potentially leading the price to test the next significant support zone around $0.47.

XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewOn the flip side, if XRP manages to stabilize and bounce back from the current support, the initial resistance is likely to be encountered near the $0.54 mark, where the 50-day moving average currently lies. This moving average has historically acted as a dynamic resistance level, and a breakout above could propel XRP toward the $0.56 level, which aligns with the 100-day moving average.

Further complicating the chart is the downward trendline that has been in play since the local high established in November. This trendline has repeatedly acted as resistance, pushing the price downward each time it has been tested. For a true reversal to be confirmed, XRP would need to break above this trendline with significant volume to validate the move.

Solana is leading pack
Solana is manifesting its strength as the top performer among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Despite overall market volatility, SOL's price action has been signaling a stronger recovery compared to other assets.
At the time of analysis, Solana is trading around the $90 mark, having rebounded with considerable momentum from the support level near $78.35. This pivotal point, bolstered by the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), has served as a springboard for the recent bullish trend. The price of SOL has been consistently creating higher lows, indicative of strong buying interest at these levels.

Resistance for SOL is currently looming at the $100 psychological level, a breakthrough of which could propel the price toward the next significant resistance at $110.

The relative strength of Solana is further substantiated by the resurgence of a risk appetite on the market, particularly evidenced by the blossoming of meme coins. This renewed interest in higher-risk assets typically bodes well for ecosystems like Solana that support a variety of decentralized applications and niche crypto projects.

Ethereum needs push
The Ethereum market is currently facing a confluence of challenges as it searches for the momentum to sustain its position. A recent chart analysis reveals an indecisive atmosphere among investors, with Ethereum struggling to find a strong directional move.
At present, Ethereum is hovering around the $2,200 mark, a level that has seen significant activity and is currently acting as a temporary support. However, the lack of bullish conviction suggests that this support level may not hold if a new wave of selling pressure emerges.

Resistance levels are observed near the $2,400 range, where previous attempts to break higher have been met with a firm rejection, indicating a substantial barrier to upward movement.

The selling pressure is partly attributed to the recent news of Celsius Network liquidating approximately $1 billion worth of Ethereum holdings. This substantial amount has the potential to saturate the market, overwhelming current liquidity and triggering a downturn. As a result, the $2,000 psychological level is eyed as the next critical support zone, a breach of which could see a sharp decline toward the $1,950 region, where the 200-day moving average lies, providing stronger historical support.

On the flip side, if Ethereum can absorb the selling pressure and gain the necessary ""fuel,"" a push above the $2,400 resistance could open the path toward the $2,500 area before challenging the more formidable resistance at $2,600, which aligns with the 50-day moving average.

"Dogecoin (DOGE) Breakout Occurs, What's Next? Solana (SOL) Stays Dominant, Will Ethereum (ETH) Survive Unseen Stalemate?","U.Today - Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency that started as a joke but became a favorite of the masses, including Elon Musk, has recently experienced a significant breakout.

After a period of consolidation, DOGE has broken past a critical resistance level, stirring excitement among traders and investors. The coin is currently sitting above the $0.088 mark, which previously acted as substantial resistance. If DOGE manages to maintain its position above this level, it could solidify this area as new support.

Dogecoin/USDT Chart by TradingViewA break above the $0.095 resistance could signal a continued bullish trend, potentially leading Dogecoin to test the psychological barrier of $0.10. If the momentum is sustained and market sentiment remains positive, DOGE could attempt to reach higher highs, possibly moving toward the $0.105 to $0.11 range last seen during its peak periods of trading activity.

Immediate support for DOGE is now at $0.088 which, if held, could act as a springboard for further climbs. However, should Dogecoin fail to maintain this level, it might fall back to its previous support near $0.078, where buyers have historically shown interest.

A scenario where DOGE's breakout continues would likely involve increased adoption news or a resurgence of interest in meme coins, potentially sparked by social media or celebrity endorsements. Such catalysts could drive demand and push DOGE past the $0.095 level, cementing its breakout status.

Conversely, if the breakout fails to sustain, perhaps due to broader market bearishness or fading interest, DOGE could slide back below $0.088. This would retest the resilience of the $0.078 support. A drop below this level could lead to a bearish phase, with DOGE potentially seeking lower ground.

Solana shows strength
During this market cycle, Solana has established itself as a leader. With its stable and easily scalable performance, it outpaces giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as the majority of DeFi volume went to the ""Ethereum killer.""
As the DeFi ecosystem on Solana flourishes, it is becoming a hub for innovation, blending meme culture with decentralized applications. The network's efficiency and scalability are attracting a wide array of developers.

The cryptocurrency that has been on a strong upward trajectory. Currently, Solana is testing a resistance level at approximately $100, a significant psychological and technical barrier. A convincing break above this level could signal continued bullish momentum, potentially leading to testing the next resistance zone around $108, which coincides with recent highs.

On the downside, the 50-day moving average, sitting near $93.23, is providing dynamic support. This level has been defended multiple times, indicating its importance to traders. If Solana can maintain its footing above this moving average, it would reinforce the asset's stability and could serve as a springboard for further gains.

The next crucial test for Solana will be sustaining above $100. Should it consolidate above this level, it would not be unrealistic to envision a push toward $108, or even higher, as the market reassesses Solana's value proposition in the context of a rapidly evolving DeFi and NFT landscape.

Fundamental Ethereum problems
As it struggles to gain momentum, Ethereum's scalability suffering and the diminishing traction of meme coins on its network are at the forefront of the bearish case for the second-biggest cryptocurrency on the market.
The network's inability to handle high transaction volumes without exorbitant fees has led to the sentiment that Ethereum is becoming ""unusable"" for the day-to-day transactions that meme coins require.

From a technical standpoint, Ethereum's price analysis paints a picture of uncertainty. The asset has been struggling to maintain momentum above crucial support levels. Currently, Ethereum is wavering around the $2,250 mark, with immediate support near the $2,150 level. A break below this support could see a decline toward the $2,000 psychological barrier, which would represent a significant bearish development.

Layer-2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum have emerged as potential stopgaps, offering faster and cheaper transactions. However, their adoption has been less than stellar, with many viewing these platforms as temporary fixes rather than a comprehensive solution to Ethereum's underlying scalability problems.

"Arbitrum (ARB) Rally Halted, Ethereum (ETH) Makes Important Reminder, Did Solana (SOL) Hit Ceiling?","U.Today - The leading layer-2 solution in the Ethereum ecosystem, Arbitrum, has recently seen a significant rally, but this has been interrupted, indicating a potential reversal in its price trajectory.

ARB's price movement had been bullish, as evidenced by its ascent past the moving averages, which served as dynamic support levels during its uptrend. However, the price has encountered substantial resistance, leading to a halt in its rally.

ARB/USDT Chart by TradingViewThe chart demonstrates ARB's struggle to maintain its upward momentum, with the token facing a critical resistance level at approximately $2.00. After failing to breach this threshold, ARB experienced a pullback, currently trading around $1.80.

The support levels to watch are strategically positioned at $1.68 and $1.47, which could provide a safety net for the price if the downward pressure persists. It may also find a stronger base at $1.32, a level that could be fundamental for buyers to reenter the market. Conversely, a bounce off the support could signal a potential for growth, with a retest of the $2.00 resistance level and possible breakout.

Ethereum shows some aggression
As the cryptocurrency market continues its dynamic ebb and flow, Ethereum (ETH) provides a salient reminder of its resilience and potential for growth. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has recently seen a reversal in its price, suggesting a potential shift in market sentiment and positioning.
The price analysis of Ethereum shows a significant level of activity around the $2,400 price point, suggesting this is a key resistance level. After a period of upward movement, ETH's price action indicates a halt and potential retracement from this level. This movement could be indicative of the market catching its breath after a period of accumulation.

Despite ETH's uptick in movement, it has not mirrored the performance of some of its contemporaries like Solana, or even Bitcoin. While these cryptocurrencies have seen more robust growth, Ethereum's progression appears more measured, possibly due to its already substantial market penetration and the maturation of its ecosystem.

The support levels for Ethereum stand firmly at around $2,197 and $2,033, which are crucial if Ethereum were to sustain a further drop in price. These levels may act as a springboard for price recovery should market conditions remain favorable. Conversely, the resistance level at approximately $2,400 is proving to be a formidable barrier to overcome.

The current technical outlook suggests Ethereum may indeed rally to test the $2,400 resistance level again. However, investors should be prepared for a possible retracement following this test. The interplay of support and resistance levels will be crucial in determining ETH's price trajectory in the short term.

Solana's rally on pause?
Solana has recently hit a metaphorical ceiling, as the fervor around the DeFi industry and meme coins that once propelled its value upward has begun to decline. This cooling on the NFT market has contributed to the deceleration in SOL's price momentum, as evidenced by the latest price charts.
A close analysis of the SOL price chart indicates a reversal from its upward trajectory, with the asset facing resistance at approximately $101. The resistance level has proven to be a formidable barrier, with Solana struggling to maintain the bullish momentum it had gained in the past.

Support levels for Solana are observed around the $94 and $76 marks. These levels may offer some respite to the asset’s price if the downward pressure continues. If Solana dips to these support levels and holds, it could signal the potential for recovery and another attempt to break through the current resistance.

Despite the recent slowdown, Solana has indeed had an impressive run. Its ecosystem continues to develop, and while the immediate future may not look as bright as it once did, the possibility of a rebound remains. The market’s cyclical nature and the potential for innovation within Solana’s platform could provide the necessary catalyst for another period of growth.

Ethereum (ETH) Price Rally Lacks Backbone, Can Bitcoin (BTC) Break Through 50 EMA?","U.Today - Chainlink has surged ahead of the rest of the crypto market with an explosive 16% rally in the last two days. This rally can be attributed to a variety of factors, not least of which is the activity spike in previously dormant wallets, signaling a resurgence of movement within the Chainlink ecosystem.

The analytics have revealed an Age Consumed spike of 5.38 billion, a metric that measures the multiplication of coins moved by the number of days they had remained passive. This sudden mobilization of LINK tokens has injected volatility and liquidity onto the market, fueling the price ascent.

LINK/USDT Chart by TradingViewFrom a technical standpoint, Chainlink's price has breached crucial resistance levels, now attempting to establish new support. The price has soared past the $15.29 mark, which previously acted as a significant resistance barrier. This breakthrough suggests robust bullish sentiment, with the potential for further growth if the momentum is sustained.

The next resistance lies at approximately $18.39, a level that, if conquered, could bolster confidence in Chainlink's uptrend. Conversely, should there be a retracement, the $14.29 level may serve as a new support, providing a safety net for the price. A dip below this could see LINK testing the $13.18 support zone, where buyers may step in to prop up the market.

No power for Ethereum
Ethereum, the second-largest decentralized network by market capitalization, is experiencing a period of stagnation, with its anticipated price rally showing signs of faltering. Despite Ethereum's prominence in the blockchain space, the network is seeing a significant challenge from competitors like Solana, which has been capturing a growing share of blockchain activity.
A closer look at Ethereum's price movement reveals a lack of momentum that could be attributed to the decrease in on-chain traction and volume. Ethereum's price is currently consolidating around the $2,300 mark, struggling to find the strength for a decisive move. The key resistance level to watch is at $2,337, where the token has faced repeated rejections. A breakthrough above this point could potentially lead to a test of the $2,450 zone, offering a glimmer of hope for bullish momentum.

However, the support levels paint a cautious picture, with $2,193 serving as the immediate floor. A breach below this could see prices slide toward the $2,042 level, which could further dampen market sentiment. The lack of volume accompanying recent price movements suggests a tentative market, with investors possibly waiting for a stronger sign of a trend reversal before committing to more substantial positions.

Bitcoin aims for breakthrough
Bitcoin has recently made a bold move, slicing through the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a key technical resistance level. This breakthrough is a sign of strength from the leading cryptocurrency, indicating a potential reversal from its recent price consolidation.
The 50 EMA has historically acted as a litmus test for Bitcoin's short-term trend direction. A sustained move above this line could validate bullish sentiment among investors, as the cryptocurrency tries to establish a new foothold for further gains. Currently, Bitcoin's price is hovering around the $42,000 mark, attempting to solidify its position above the 50 EMA.

In terms of price analysis, the successful breach of the 50 EMA has set the stage for Bitcoin to test the next resistance level near $43,500. This level is critical as a break above could pave the way for a move toward the $45,000 resistance zone. However, it is essential to note that Bitcoin needs to maintain its current momentum to prevent fallbacks below the 50 EMA, which could dampen the optimistic outlook.

"DOGE ETF, SOL ETF May Potentially Emerge by 2025, Lark Davis Explains How","U.Today - Crypto YouTuber Lark Davis has shared a video in which he elaborates why he expects the second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, to see $4,000 as the first stop on its way to $10,000.

He also said that altcoin-based ETFs may flood into the market soon enough, and those would include Solana and Dogecoin ETFs in particular.

Ethereum heading for $4,000
The main message that Lark Davis wanted to get across on X was that he believes it is highly likely that Ethereum will reach $4,000 by the end of May this year — May 23, to be exact, this is the date when the regulator is expected to green-light a spot Ethereum ETF.
Davis made a reminder that Standard Chartered bank (LON:STAN) made this prediction, drawing the deadline at $4,000. The main reason why the banking giant made such a prediction is because it expects a spot Ethereum ETF to be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission this year, therefore, the bank’s thesis says, the ETF will drive massive demand for Ethereum, the same as it did for Bitcoin.

BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and the other spot-based Bitcoin ETFs started scooping up astounding chunks of BTC before the SEC regulator approved their filings, and they continue to buy 5x more BTC than the daily amount of Bitcoin produced by miners.

So far, the regulator has been delaying its decision on the Ethereum ETF, however, Davis agrees with the Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) forecast that it is likely to make an approval on May 23.

DOGE, SOL, LINK, AVAX ETFs are likely: Davis
Davis voiced the opinion that once the SEC permits spot Ethereum ETFs to start trading, this would give a start to hedge funds deciding to launch exchange-traded funds based on other altcoins.
The YouTuber supposed that the cryptocurrency market may see ETFs launched based on such altcoins as Dogecoin, Solana, Chainlink, Avalanche, maybe even by the end of 2024. What led him to this thought was the Franklin Templeton fund.

In a recent interview to Bloomberg, a rep of this fund hinted that the market may see more ETF filings coming from them, and the rep stated that Ethereum seems like a good candidate for that to begin with.

Ethereum (ETH) Staking Ratio Surprisingly Keeps Surging Despite Shapella,"U.Today - Ki Young Ju, founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, leading on-chain analytical firm, shared his views on the Ethereum (ETH) staking progress. He admits he was wrong about Shapella hard fork's effects.

Ethereum (ETH) staking ratio surges to 24% and counting
Ethereum (ETH) staking ratio, i.e., the percentage of ETH coins locked in staking, reaches 24% and keeps surging. Meanwhile, only 11% of the ETH supply is stored on centralized exchanges. The data was shared by Ki Young Ju on X today, on Jan. 18, 2024.
As such, it is safe to say that the overhyped Ethereum (ETH) upgrade Shapella that allowed stakers to withdraw their coins for the first time since December 2020 did not result in massive unstaking:

Ethereum's (ETH) Shapella was activated in April 2023. As crypto markets were still dominated by bearish sentiment, analysts were expecting withdrawals and consecutive sell-offs of Ethereum (ETH).

The Ethereum (ETH) price also managed to go through this event without significant losses: as stakers withdrew 1 million Ethers (ETH) in first week post-Shapella, the ETH price was fluctuating between $2,000 and $2,100.

Staked Ethereums (ETH) are mostly profitable, Mr. Ki Young Ju adds. While the realized price for staking inflows is $2,014, the current ETH rate is $2,519. As such, the average Ether ""stake"" is being held with a significant 25% profit.

The aggregated volume of the Ethereum (ETH) staking ecosystem is estimated at a whopping $72 billion, with 4.25% in APY, Staking Rewards data says.

Сardano (ADA) staking close to surpassing Solana (SOL)
At the same time, the largest Ethereum (ETH) competitors might be close to a historic ""flippening."" The Solana (SOL) staking ratio is plummeting. The indicator lost over 20% in the last week and dipped below 67%.
Meanwhile, the Cardano (ADA) staking ecosystem added 0.06% in the last seven days and is getting closer to 64%. At the same time, the USD-denominated volume of Solana (SOL) staking is over 200% larger than that of Cardano (ADA).

Out of all mainstream altcoins, Mina Protocol (MINA) demonstrates the largest staking ratio: its stakers locked over 91% of the circulating supply.

Aptos (APT) and Sui (SUI) follow the Mina Protocol (MINA) with 85%-86% in staking ratio.

"Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin Makes Surprising Visit to Binance, SHIB Rep Shares Shibarium's Plans to Onboard Thousands of Projects: Crypto News Digest by U.Today","U.Today - Take a look at the most important crypto events with U.Today's top three news stories.

Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin makes surprising visit to Binance
As has been recently shared by Binance CEO Richard Teng on the X platform, Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin made a surprising visit to the Binance office. Teng thanked Buterin for finding time to speak to his team in person, saying that it was a privilege to have him in the company's office. This spontaneous visit caused quite a stir in the crypto community, with many users speculating about a potential collaboration between these two giants of the crypto market. As a reminder, Binance is currently struggling with a $4 billion fine and ongoing regulatory challenges; considering this, Buterin's focus (described in his essay entitled ""Make Ethereum Cypherpunk Again"") on security, privacy and scalability, and concern for centralized exchanges and their vulnerability to hacking, feed rumors about possible cooperation between Buterin and Binance. However, neither Buterin nor Teng made any statements in this regard.
Shibarium: Thousands of projects to join L2 network with numerous partnerships – SHIB rep
In a recent X post, Shiba Inu team member Lucie shared Shibarium's plans for the future. Lucie wrote that the layer-2 solution aims to ""onboard 1,000 projects with numerous partnerships,"" reminding the community that supporting new projects does not necessarily mean canceling existing ones. The SHIB representative then called on all meme token supporters to stay strong as a community during challenging times, stating that there is hardly any point in giving up now if they got ""this far"" in their support for the project's team. Lucie's post has evoked mixed reactions among SHIB army members; even though many of them praised the SHIB developers, some users questioned the project team's ability to accomplish anything more than just making plans and promising new advances.
JPMorgan: Bitcoin ETF hype cooling
According to Kenneth Worthington, analyst at JPMorgan, the initial enthusiasm surrounding Bitcoin ETFs may be waning, with a shift toward a ""more normalized flow environment"" being potentially on the horizon. On Jan. 26, spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced net sales of about $15 million following a four-day streak of redemptions. This reversal could be an indication of changing investor sentiment on these novel financial products. Since their launch, the Bitcoin price has plunged by about 9% but has since stabilized around $42,000 as the new trading week gets underway. Previously, JPMorgan correctly predicted that the approval of Bitcoin ETFs would be a sell-the-news event. Before the approval, the price of the leading cryptocurrency dropped from above $47,000 to below $39,000. The sell-off coincided with large outflows from Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which transitioned into a spot Bitcoin ETF after the SEC's approval.

"Here's Who Burned 9,001 ETH in Last 30 Days","U.Today - Uniswap, the world’s largest decentralized exchange, is apparently a top burner of Ethereum, with a staggering 9,001 ETH incinerated from the circulating supply in the last 30 days. This activity firmly positions Uniswap as a key player in the Ethereum ecosystem, not just in terms of volume but also in influencing the coin's scarcity.

The mechanism behind Ethereum's burn is a recent upgrade known as EIP-1559, which introduced a transaction fee burn for every operation made on the network. Uniswap, as the leading DEX, handles a massive volume of transactions, naturally leading to a higher rate of ETH being burned. This burn acts as a deflationary force on the supply of Ethereum, theoretically creating scarcity that could bolster the asset's value over the long term.

ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewHowever, the correlation between burn rate and immediate price action is not linear. While Uniswap's significant contribution to the burn rate underscores its dominance, the short-term impact on Ethereum’s price is subdued. Over a longer horizon, this deflationary mechanism is expected to establish a supportive base for the price of ETH, as reducing supply, ceteris paribus, should increase the value of each remaining ETH.

It is important to note, though, that scarcity alone does not guarantee value growth. The intrinsic value of Ethereum also hinges on its utility, adoption and broader market sentiment. Currently, Ethereum is facing stiff competition from Solana in ecosystem growth, with many traders who favor volatility and risk gravitating toward Solana.

A technical analysis of Ethereum's current price action shows a challenging market phase. Ethereum is attempting to hold support around the $2,400 level. Should it fail to sustain this, the next key support is observed at the $2,300 mark, near the 50-day EMA. A breach below this could see Ethereum test the $2,000 psychological support level. Conversely, if Ethereum can rally past the immediate resistance at $2,500, it could pave the way to retest previous highs near $2,800.

"Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin Makes Surprising Visit to Binance, New CEO Richard Teng Shares","U.Today - In an unexpected turn of events, Ethereum (ETH) cofounder and prominent figure in the cryptocurrency industry, Vitalik Buterin, paid a surprise visit to the Binance office. The revelation came from the CEO of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, Richard Teng, who shared the news on his X page.

Teng expressed his gratitude for the privilege of hosting Buterin.

The impromptu meeting sparked a flurry of speculation within the crypto community, as enthusiasts and experts alike pondered the potential collaboration between these two giants of the crypto market. Notably, Binance has been grappling with heightened regulatory scrutiny in recent months, leading to the legal predicament of its former CEO, Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao.

This unexpected rendezvous holds significance, given Buterin and Binance's history of active collaboration, such as Buterin's contribution to the proof-of-reserves concept for centralized crypto exchanges just two years ago. Against the backdrop of Binance's $4 billion fine and ongoing regulatory challenges, the nature of the discussions between Buterin and the Binance team remains shrouded in mystery.
Vitalik Buterin's recent focus, as evident in his essay titled ""Make Ethereum Cypherpunk Again,"" centers on security, privacy and scalability. Notably, he addressed concerns about centralized exchanges and their vulnerability to hacking — a topic that adds fuel to the speculation of potential collaborative efforts between Buterin and Binance.

Vitalik Buterin Answers Major Bitcoin and Ethereum Question in Birthday Essay,"U.Today - Renowned Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin celebrated his 30 birthday today by releasing a thoughtful essay titled ""The End of My Childhood."" The essay delves into the genesis of cryptocurrencies, and Bitcoin in particular, underscoring its initial purpose as a response to the vulnerabilities of traditional banking systems.

In his reflective piece, Buterin questions the evolution of public discourse within the crypto space over the past 15 years, pondering whether the original narrative emphasizing financial disruption has waned. To address this, he proposes two pragmatic approaches for the crypto ecosystem.

First, Buterin advocates for a renewed emphasis on the significance of money and finance, urging the crypto space to actively contribute to serving underserved populations and fostering financial inclusion. Second, he envisions a broader role for crypto that extends beyond finance.

Highlighting the unique decentralized nature of the crypto industry, Buterin notes that developers are dispersed globally, and many major crypto projects are not bound by geographical constraints.

The essay delves into the genesis of cryptocurrencies, and Bitcoin in particular, underscoring its initial purpose as a response to the vulnerabilities of traditional banking systems.

In his reflective piece, Buterin questions the evolution of public discourse within the crypto space over the past 15 years, pondering whether the original narrative emphasizing financial disruption has waned. To address this, he proposes two pragmatic approaches for the crypto ecosystem.

First, Buterin advocates for a renewed emphasis on the significance of money and finance, urging the crypto space to actively contribute to serving underserved populations and fostering financial inclusion. Second, he envisions a broader role for crypto that extends beyond finance.

Highlighting the unique decentralized nature of the crypto industry, Buterin notes that developers are dispersed globally, and many major crypto projects are not bound by geographical constraints. He emphasizes the potential of non-Western developers to understand and address the concrete needs of users in low-income countries.

Ethereum (ETH) Needs These 3 Crucial Factors to Align for Growth: Details,"U.Today - Despite Ethereum's position as a frontrunner in the altcoin sector, its growth has been stunted by a bearish trend that has held a tight grip on the market in recent weeks. A closer look at the ETH chart reveals that the expected volatility spike that could catalyze a bullish reversal has yet to materialize.

Layer-2 network adoption and ecosystem expansion
First, the surge of layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism could be a catalyst for Ethereum's growth. These networks aim to enhance Ethereum's ecosystem by providing the much-needed scalability and reduced fees, potentially driving renewed interest and increased adoption of the Ethereum network.

Scalability and network efficiency
Second, Ethereum's persistent scalability issues must be addressed. Despite the implementation of EIP-1559, which was anticipated to make transaction fees more predictable, the network still struggles under high demand, leading to exorbitant fees and reduced network functionality. Resolving these scalability woes is crucial, as a more efficient and cost-effective network is vital for Ethereum to retain its value and utility.
Introduction of Ethereum ETF
Finally, the establishment of an Ethereum ETF would be a strong bullish signal, mirroring the impact of the Bitcoin ETF. An Ethereum ETF would pave the way for institutional investment, providing a regulated and accessible means for traditional investors to gain exposure to ETH. This could secure Ethereum's future as a mainstream financial asset and provide a stable foundation for long-term growth.
Looking at the Ethereum chart, we identify a local resistance level at approximately $2433.5, a price point that has acted as a hurdle in recent trading sessions. For a bullish case to solidify, Ethereum needs to break past this resistance with conviction. Should this occur, it could signal a shift in investor sentiment and open the path to higher price levels.

"Samson Mow Takes Subtle Jab at Ethereum (ETH), Is XRP Next?","U.Today - Samson Mow, the chief executive officer of investment firm Jan3 and prominent Bitcoin (BTC) bull and evangelist, has taken his advocacy for the top coin to a new level. In his latest post on X, he took a subtle jab at alternative investment assets, including Silver and Ethereum (ETH), as his way of reducing their viability in comparison to their counterparts Gold and Silver.

Samson Mow analogy
According to Samson Mow, Silver is the poor man’s Gold, a statement that shows that investors who consider the latter to be too expensive typically opt in for the former. While both are respected metals and investment assets, Gold is still considered the superior of the two.
Samson Mow deflated Ethereum’s ego to end the long-standing superiority debate with Bitcoin. The vocal investor noted that ""Ethereum is the stupid man's Bitcoin,"" a statement that spooked members of the ETH community.

By valuation, Bitcoin’s market cap currently stands at $809,923,408,001, while that of Ethereum comes in at $297,575,053,741. The price differentials of $41,344.01 to $2,476.66 also show that Bitcoin is the most valuable of the two. Over time, there have been conversations about shifting capital from BTC to ETH, a trend that might be amplified in the coming months if Ethereum’s key fundamentals come into play.

The harsh criticism of Ethereum did not go down well with its community members, with some pointing out the key improvements the protocol has made as a blockchain in itself.

Is XRP next?
As a Bitcoin Maxi, Samson Mow was asked by one of the commenters on his post what he thinks about XRP if Ethereum is the poor man’s Bitcoin. He simply answered that the demand is a ""tricky one.""
Samson Mow’s confidence in Bitcoin has made him forecast a $1 million price target, and his lack of confidence in XRP and Ethereum has undoubtedly made his bearish stand subtle.

Ethereum (ETH) Faces Serious Bug; Here's Who Might Be Affected,"U.Today - Ethereum is potentially facing a significant bug that has emerged, previously only assumed as a hypothetical scenario in discussions among the developer and validator community back in March 2022, but now it looms as a potential threat that could become a reality.

This bug concerns the Ethereum staking mechanism and how the network reaches consensus. In essence, if a majority client, holding more than 2/3 of the stake, has a bug, it could inadvertently build an invalid chain that the network would consider finalized due to the majority stake's ""agreement.""

If validators running this buggy client commit to this incorrect chain, any attempt to switch to a correct chain could result in severe penalties due to how the Ethereum protocol is designed to penalize what it sees as ""equivocating"" validators.

What makes this situation particularly alarming is the scale of the potential impact. If this bug manifests, the validators could find themselves in a predicament where they either continue to support an incorrect chain or switch to a correct one at great personal cost. The validators running the buggy client would face a dilemma: lose their stake through penalties or persist with an invalid chain, endangering the network's integrity.

For the average Ethereum holder not involved in staking or blockchain development, this might seem distant, but the implications can be far-reaching. An individual commented that the situation is ""pretty scary,"" and it is also the main reason why they do not stake any ETH. This sentiment reflects a potentially surging concern among holders who fear the ripple effects a bug of this magnitude could have on the network's trust and stability.

Centralized exchanges (CEXes), although well capitalized, might also feel the effect of potential finalization issues. Though their liquidity is far more resilient, mitigating large losses might still become an issue.

"Ethereum Whale Moves $46 Million in ETH Across Binance, Bitfinex and Aave: Details","U.Today - In a surprising move that has captured the attention of the cryptocurrency community, an Ethereum (ETH) whale has orchestrated a series of transactions involving major exchanges, moving a staggering $46.02 million in ETH over the past two days. The entity, utilizing a network of eight wallets, withdrew funds from Binance and Bitfinex before staking with Lido, a liquid staking solution.

Blockchain analytics platform Spot On Chain first brought attention to the substantial transactions through a tweet, revealing intricate details of the massive ETH movement. The whale withdrew the Ethereum holdings from crypto exchanges Binance and Bitfinex at an average price of approximately $2,419.

Subsequently, five wallets were employed to withdraw 50.15 million USDT from Aave, a prominent DeFi protocol, to the CEX trading platform, exchanging the stablecoin for 19,021 ETH, equivalent to the $46.02 million value. Spot On Chain further disclosed that three wallets still retained around 30 million USDT in Aave, sparking speculation that they might deposit these funds into a CEX soon, potentially acquiring more ETH.

Ethereum price struggles
The timing of these transactions coincided with a challenging period for the Ethereum market. At the time of the whale's activity, the price of ETH struggled, recording a 4.57% dip in the last 24 hours and a 9.46% decline in the past week. Current market data indicates ETH trading at $2,296.
Coinglass, another analytics platform, reported a significant amount of liquidations for ETH within the last 24 hours, totaling $53.78 million. Of this amount, $47.48 million resulted from long liquidations, while short liquidations accounted for $6.29 million. The liquidation data underscores the volatility and uncertainty prevalent on the market, with traders experiencing significant losses.

Market analysts and enthusiasts are closely monitoring these developments, as such large-scale transactions from influential entities often lead to speculation and conjecture regarding potential market impacts. Traders and investors are advised to exercise caution and stay vigilant as the cryptocurrency landscape continues to unfold, revealing the dynamics of this rapidly evolving market.

Meme Coin BITCOIN Price Skyrockets After Vitalik Buterin Apologizes,"U.Today - In a surprising turn of events today, the price of meme cryptocurrency BITCOIN experienced an extraordinary surge, reaching almost 50%, following Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin's public apology. The unprecedented rise came after Buterin admitted to a misunderstanding in one of his essays, where he had previously referred to the meme coin as a scam attempting to impersonate the real Bitcoin.

The controversy surrounding Buterin's remarks took an unexpected twist when a passionate crypto enthusiast reached out to him, shedding light on the true nature of the meme coin. Contrary to Buterin's initial assessment, the enthusiast clarified that BITCOIN is not a scam but a legitimate asset with its own dedicated community. As a testament to their commitment, the BITCOIN community shared heartwarming stories of their charitable endeavors, including the construction of wells in Nigeria and the provision of uniforms and equipment to children's soccer teams.

The community's efforts caught Buterin's attention, prompting him to reevaluate his stance on the meme coin. In a subsequent post, Buterin not only corrected his earlier comments but also issued a formal apology for any confusion caused.

Ethereum (ETH) Becomes Target of Massive $1 Billion Sell-Off: Who's Responsible?,"U.Today - Ethereum is encountering a massive sell-off exceeding $1 billion. The source of this enormous market movement can be traced back to Celsius, which reportedly transferred a staggering 459,561 ETH, valued at approximately $1.014 billion, to various exchanges.

The distribution of this sell-off was as follows: 297,454 ETH ($656.5 million) moved to Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) Prime, 146,507 ETH to Paxos Treasury and smaller amounts of 7,800 ETH each, totaling $17.2 million, were transferred to FalconX and Coinbase. Despite this massive transfer, Celsius reportedly retains a reserve of 62,468 ETH, worth around $139 million.

Such a colossal sale exerts immense pressure on Ethereum's price and could significantly sway market sentiment. The immediate concern for investors and traders is whether Ethereum's liquidity and market capitalization can absorb such a hit without triggering a broad market downturn.

From a technical analysis standpoint, the massive outflow from Celsius is a bearish signal, likely to test Ethereum's local support levels. A crucial support to watch is around the $2,000 price range, a psychological and technical support level, which, if breached, could see the price tumble to the next significant support at $1,800. This level has historically acted as a strong buy zone and may serve as a robust defense against further declines.

Conversely, resistance levels have become more formidable due to the sell-off. Any potential recovery will have to confront the resistance at $2,200, which previously acted as a support level. A break above this could see Ethereum attempt to reclaim higher price levels, possibly testing the $2,400 resistance.

The substantial sell-off initiated by Celsius has placed Ethereum in a problematic position. Although the Ethereum network's fundamentals remain robust, the asset's price resilience in the face of such a significant sell-off shows the actual state of the market.

$13 Milion in Ethereum (ETH) Destroyed as Supply Becomes Deflationary Again,"U.Today - The recent data from Ethereum network indicates that the supply of Ethereum has once again entered a deflationary phase. Over the past 30 days, a striking $13 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) has been destroyed, with the net supply change showing a decrease of 5,619.39 ETH. This deflationary pressure is due to the network's burning mechanism, which has incinerated 74,933.24 ETH, outstripping the 69,313.86 ETH issued in the same period.

The implications of this deflationary trend could signal an approaching rally for Ethereum. A deflationary supply inherently suggests that the available quantity of ETH is decreasing, which could lead to an increase in value per token, assuming demand stays the same or grows. This dynamic, combined with the Ethereum network's continuous development and adoption, may set the stage for a bullish scenario.

ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewAnalyzing the Ethereum chart, a crucial factor is the potential breakthrough of the 50-day Exponential Moving Average. Currently, Ethereum hovers just below this significant level, and a break above could confirm a shift in market sentiment, potentially igniting upward price movement.

However, it is essential to acknowledge that Ethereum's current market traction is relatively muted. Despite the burn and the deflationary state of supply, the lack of significant network activity or groundbreaking updates has kept the token from gaining substantial momentum. Even activities by Ethereum's cofounder, Vitalik Buterin, which have historically influenced the market, seem to provide only a moderate push at best, under current conditions.

The market awaits a catalyst that could reignite Ethereum's dominance in the blockchain space. While the reduction in supply is a positive sign, without an accompanying increase in demand or network utility, the impact on price may be limited.

Ethereum Closer to Epic Rebranding as Sepolia Welcomes Dencun Upgrade,"U.Today - The Ethereum blockchain is on its way to a massive rebranding as its long-awaited Dencun upgrade is now live on the Sepolia testnet. The Ethereum Foundation projected that the Dencun upgrade would launch on Sepolia by Jan. 30, and the successful integration was revealed by core developer Terrence.eth, for which he received many accolades from the community.

The Dencun upgrade going live on Sepolia is one of the two remaining steps required to launch the update on the Ethereum mainnet. Ethereum has long been plagued with lower scalability and high gas fees. For this, it has continued to receive intense backlash from industry analysts like legendary trader Peter Brandt, who considers its high cost of operation a basis for its demise in the long term.

The Dencun upgrade will attempt to resolve scalability issues while also making Ethereum more cost-effective as a protocol. The Dencun upgrade will specifically introduce proto-danksharding, a compressed data storage mechanism dubbed ""blobs"" to help optimize performance.

Development efforts are now in their advanced stages as the upgrade was launched on the Goerli testnet earlier this month. The last step before the mainnet debut will be to launch on the Holesky testnet, an upgrade that is scheduled for Feb. 7.

Ethereum to fight back against its competitors
Many new protocols have emerged to capitalize on the weakness of the Ethereum protocol. From Solana (SOL) to Cardano (ADA) and even Avalanche (AVAX), the race to dethrone Ethereum remains the core mantra for many developers in the Web3 ecosystem today.
With the Dencun upgrade, many of the pain points on Ethereum can be resolved, thus making the protocol more attractive to developers and end users overall. With the upgrade, Ethereum is poised to extend its dominance as the top blockchain of choice for all things decentralized finance (DeFi) and more.

The Ethereum Foundation projected that the Dencun upgrade would launch on Sepolia by Jan. 30, and the successful integration was revealed by core developer Terrence.eth, for which he received many accolades from the community.

The Dencun upgrade going live on Sepolia is one of the two remaining steps required to launch the update on the Ethereum mainnet. Ethereum has long been plagued with lower scalability and high gas fees. For this, it has continued to receive intense backlash from industry analysts like legendary trader Peter Brandt, who considers its high cost of operation a basis for its demise in the long term.

The Dencun upgrade will attempt to resolve scalability issues while also making Ethereum more cost-effective as a protocol. The Dencun upgrade will specifically introduce proto-danksharding, a compressed data storage mechanism dubbed ""blobs"" to help optimize performance.

Major FED Decision to Affect Crypto Market in Two Days,"U.Today - The crypto market is bracing itself as the Federal Reserve gears up to announce its first interest rate decision of 2024. The whispers from the CME about a 96.9% chance to keep interest rates unchanged are causing ripples. Yet, with the second decision in March casting a 47% shadow of a rate cut by 25 basis points (bps), investors are on edge. Adding to the economic fervor, the United States is set to release the January unemployment rate, which could further sway market sentiment.

The Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates is a critical economic lever that traditionally influences traditional markets and, as has been seen, the cryptocurrency market as well. An unchanged interest rate could maintain the status quo, possibly keeping investment steady in assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

A cut, however, could signal economic caution, potentially reducing the attractiveness of risk assets like cryptocurrencies or, conversely, could lead investors to seek higher returns in the crypto market if traditional investments falter.

BTC/USD Chart by TradingViewAnalyzing the Bitcoin chart, there is a distinctive ""war"" between the bulls and bears. The immediate resistance level to watch is around the $42,500 mark, which Bitcoin has been testing recently. This level is crucial because a decisive close above it could signal increasing bullish momentum. On the downside, the support level at approximately $39,528, aligning with a psychological round number and a previous area of interest, is one that traders are likely to defend vigorously.

The upcoming Fed decision could serve as a catalyst for Bitcoin's next big move. If interest rates remain unchanged, Bitcoin could continue to test the resistance level, and a break above could confirm a bullish reversal. However, should rates decrease, Bitcoin's reaction might be even more unpredictable.

"Shiba Inu (SHIB) Rapidly Breaks Down, Ethereum (ETH) Loses Traction, While Solana (SOL) Presents Hidden Opportunity","U.Today - Shiba Inu has experienced a significant breakdown from its recent consolidation phase. The chart depicts a clear downward trajectory as SHIB failed to maintain its position within the ascending triangle pattern it had formed over the past few months.

The breakdown was signaled as SHIB prices breached the key support level at $0.000009, which had previously acted as a reliable floor for the price during consolidation phases. Following this, SHIB prices tumbled further, slicing through subsequent support near $0.0000087. This price action marked a decisive shift in market sentiment from accumulation to distribution.

SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewThe next support level to watch is at $0.0000082, where SHIB may find a temporary reprieve from the selling pressure. If this level fails to hold, the next critical support lies at $0.0000076, which could serve as the last line of defense before a more significant drop.

For a reversal to occur and for SHIB to regain its upward momentum, it would need to reclaim previous support levels and transform them back into supports. This would require a substantial influx of buying pressure, potentially sparked by positive developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem or broader cryptocurrency market rallies.

The first sign of a possible reversal would be a return above $0.0000087, followed by a sustained move above the $0.000009 price level. A breakout above these levels, accompanied by increasing volume, could indicate that the downtrend is losing steam and that bulls are regaining control.

Solana paints reversal pattern
Solana has been developing a subtle yet potentially pivotal chart pattern. The asset has been tracing a slow and steady ascending channel, a formation that suggests a controlled and consistent uptrend. This pattern, characterized by higher lows and higher highs contained within two parallel trendlines, speaks to potential for continued growth.
The significance of this pattern lies in the momentum it could provide for SOL. Should the price action remain strong within the upper half of the channel, and particularly if it challenges the upper trendline, we could see Solana break through and embark on a more aggressive rally.

Such a bullish scenario would likely be supported by increased trading volume and positive developments within the Solana ecosystem, such as new project launches or updates that enhance network performance.

The immediate local resistance stands at around $55, and a confident push beyond this could confirm bullish sentiment. Inversely, if Solana's price dips below the channel's lower boundary, around $48, it could indicate that a bearish narrative is taking hold.

Ethereum momentum decreasing
Ethereum is exhibiting signs of waning momentum, as observed in recent price movements. The asset, which has long been considered the backbone of the decentralized finance sector, is facing a pivotal moment that could determine its trajectory for the coming weeks.
The provided chart illustrates Ethereum's struggle to maintain its grasp on the market. The price has been on a downward trend, edging closer to the local 26-day Exponential Moving Average. This level, currently near $2,465, is critical; if Ethereum fails to hold this line, we might see it descend to test the more significant 50 EMA, which stands around the $2,300 mark.

The 26 EMA serves as a short-term sentiment gauge, and its breach could signal a lack of immediate bullish support. Should this level fail to act as a springboard for price recovery, Ethereum's next stop could indeed be the 50 EMA. A breach below this longer-term moving average could potentially open the gates for a test of lower support levels, highlighting the need for investors to brace for more volatility.

Market participants are now recalibrating their expectations, understanding that the road to sustainable gains is a long-term journey.

"XRP's Epic Battle Against Bears, Solana Breaks $100, While Ethereum Fights for Momentum","U.Today - XRP is currently locked in a fierce struggle with bearish forces. The digital asset, which operates within the Ripple network, is experiencing difficulty establishing a position above a critical technical indicator — the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).

The 200 EMA serves as an important barometer for the long-term trend and investor sentiment. For XRP, remaining below this level suggests that the asset lacks the bullish momentum needed to shift into an upward trajectory. This inability to secure a foothold above the 200 EMA raises questions about the stability of positive price action in the near term.

XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewTechnical analysis shows that the 200 EMA is a dynamic level of resistance that many traders watch closely. A consistent failure to breach this mark can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy where the resistance level grows stronger, as more traders set their sell orders around this key price point.

Ethereum keeps on struggling
Ethereum is showing signs of losing its upward momentum, failing to form a higher high — an indicator that market experts often interpret as a sign of an impending price correction.
The ETH chart reveals a telling pattern; the absence of a new higher high is significant. Typically, in a bullish market phase, the price of an asset creates a series of higher highs and higher lows. However, Ethereum's inability to push beyond its recent peak may suggest that the bulls are running out of steam and a reevaluation of market sentiment could be underway.

Analyzing the chart, the local resistance level has been a tough ceiling for Ethereum to break. This resistance, where sell orders tend to cluster, is acting as a barrier preventing further upward movement. On the flip side, the support level represents a price point with a concentration of buy orders, offering a potential cushion against a price drop. If Ethereum fails to uphold the support level, it could trigger a price breakdown, signaling a shift to a bearish trend.

If Ethereum's price continues to struggle, the scenario could unfold where the asset drops further, testing subsequent support levels. While the underlying fundamentals of Ethereum, such as network upgrades and adoption rates, remain robust, the short-term price action could still be subject to corrective forces.

Solana wants another round
The battleground of volatility on the crypto market continues, and Solana (SOL) has not been spared from its whims. Once a darling of the crypto world for its speed and efficiency, SOL has recently been up against a wall, struggling to surpass the crucial $100 mark. The price chart reflects a narrative of struggle and resistance, painting a picture of an asset in need of momentum.
The technical outlook for SOL is looking promising. After a period of bullish activity that piqued the interest of many investors, SOL has hit a snag near the $100 resistance level. This resistance level represents a significant psychological and financial barrier, as it is where sell orders tend to accumulate, putting downward pressure on the price.

Despite efforts to rally, the asset has been unable to generate the necessary momentum to overcome this threshold with ease and currently consolidates at it. One of the key factors influencing this lackluster performance could be the market's tepid reaction to the announcement of Solana phone Saga 2. The news, which might have been expected to inject some enthusiasm onto the market, failed to provide substantial support for Solana's price.

Looking at the chart, the local support levels are clearly delineated. The first line of defense for SOL lies around the $88-$90 price range, where previous dips have found buyers waiting. Should this level fail to hold, the next support may not emerge until it reaches the more robust $70 level, which could act as a stronger foothold for the price.

Conversely, resistance beyond $100 is now more formidable than ever. With each rejection, the resolve of buyers weakens, and the $100 level transforms from a mere price point into a crucial psychological level you should not miss.

"Shiba Inu (SHIB) Becoming Bullish, Ethereum (ETH) Price Screams Rally Continuation, Bitcoin (BTC) Not Giving up Market Dominance","U.Today - Shiba Inu currently displays an ascending triangle pattern on the SHIB/USDT chart. This technical formation is widely recognized and could be a signal to a significant price surge for the meme.

An ascending triangle is characterized by a flat upper resistance line and a rising lower support line. This pattern suggests that buyers are gradually gaining ground against sellers, as each dip is bought up at a higher level than the previous one, indicating accumulating pressure for an upward breakout.

SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewFor Shiba Inu, which has been lingering in a period of relatively nonexistent activity, this pattern could serve as massive fuel for volatility in the near future. Recent market conditions have seen a decline in interest toward legacy meme coins, with SHIB being no exception. The lack of significant developments within the Shiba Inu network has contributed to the muted activity around this cryptocurrency.

In contrast, the majority of the action in the meme coin sector has been taking place on the Solana network. This platform has become a hotbed for the deployment of new meme coins, which are exhibiting far greater volatility than those on the Ethereum network, where Shiba Inu resides. The brisk activity on Solana contrasts sharply with the sluggishness observed in Ethereum's meme coin space, drawing in traders and investors looking for quick gains and high excitement.

Ethereum's correction is temporary
The Ethereum market is currently exhibiting a correction, and there are patterns that suggest a rally may not only be on the horizon but could also be in continuation. The asset has recently experienced a sharp downturn, movement that is readily apparent on intraday timeframes. However, such stark movements are often precursors to reversals, signaling that Ethereum could be gearing up for an upswing.
A closer look at the charts shows Ethereum's price action respecting a series of key technical indicators which, together, build a case for potential upward momentum. The asset has been tracing back to touch base with its moving averages, a behavior that is typically followed by a rebound, as these levels can act as dynamic support zones.

This corrective phase is noteworthy, especially considering the robust rally Ethereum enjoyed in the preceding weeks. Corrections are a natural and healthy part of any asset's price trajectory, allowing for consolidation before the next leg up. For Ethereum, the current pullback could be shaking out weak hands, setting the stage for a stronger rally propelled by a more committed investor base.

Bitcoin's dominance not going anywhere
After a brief breach below the 50-day EMA — a critical indicator of medium-term market sentiment — Bitcoin has clawed its way back above this pivotal level. This move indicates a bullish signal for market observers, suggesting that Bitcoin is not yet ready to relinquish its market dominance.
However, the ascent above the 50 EMA has not been met with the kind of vigorous momentum that bulls would hope for. The growth has been moderate, hinting that Bitcoin might encounter selling pressure as it ascends. This is not unusual on the crypto markets, where significant moves often face immediate resistance as traders take profits and skeptics cast doubts.

The recent price action has been a roller coaster for Bitcoin, which saw its value tumble from highs around $47,000 to lows near $41,000. This downturn briefly shifted the spotlight to altcoins, which seized the moment to stage local rallies. The diversification of gains across the crypto spectrum during Bitcoin's periods of weakness is a trend that has become more pronounced as the overall market matures.

Yet Bitcoin's ability to push back above the 50 EMA serves as a reminder of its underlying strength and the confidence investors have placed in it. Despite the opportunity for altcoins to rise, Bitcoin remains the anchor of the crypto market, with its moves often dictating broader market sentiment. This recent rebound above a crucial technical level could be interpreted as Bitcoin's silent assertion that it is not ready to give up the throne just yet.

"Ethereum (ETH) In Dangerous Position, Bitcoin (BTC) About to Lose $40,000, Shiba Inu (SHIB) At Local Support","U.Today - Ethereum finds itself shaky on the edge of a precarious position. The recent price chart indicates a concerning situation: the 26-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a key indicator of short-term momentum, is under threat. If this level fails to hold, Ethereum could see its value dip to the $2,347 mark, a scenario that may well trigger a more pronounced decline.

This potential slip below the 26 EMA is crucial because it suggests a weakening in buying pressure and a shift in market sentiment from accumulation to potential distribution. A break below this level would not only establish $2,347 as the next price floor but could also exacerbate the asset's losses, leading to further bearish momentum.

ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewThe Ethereum ecosystem has faced its share of challenges despite the rise of layer 2-networks, which have not catalyzed the anticipated rally. The broader market has similarly not exhibited the explosive bull run many investors had hoped for, with Ethereum’s trajectory reflecting this subdued market energy.

Additional support and resistance zones can be gleaned from the chart. On the support side, following the $2,347 level, the next critical support lies around $2,175.2 - a breach of which could see ETH test the psychological and technical support near the $2,000 level. Resistance, on the other hand, is firmly established at the recent high of $2,547.6. This price point serves as a litmus test for Ethereum’s ability to rebound and reclaim bullish momentum.

The current market dynamics, marked by cautious trading and a lack of definitive direction, have placed Ethereum in a zone of uncertainty. Investors are advised to monitor these levels closely, as a break below or above these could signal Ethereum's next significant move.

Bitcoin in trouble
Bitcoin finds itself at a precarious juncture as it teeters on the edge of the critical $40,000 mark. The recent price action paints a troubling picture for Bitcoin enthusiasts, with the asset losing its grip on the 50-day Exponential Moving Average, a key support level that has historically indicated bullish sentiment.
As Bitcoin's price struggles to maintain the $40,000 level, the next potential foothold lies at the 100-day EMA. However, this level does not traditionally offer substantial support, and a breach below could precipitate a fall below $39,000, triggering heightened market concern. The chart reveals that the next major support zone stands near the $35,888 mark, a level that buyers might attempt to defend vigorously.

On the resistance front, Bitcoin faces a significant challenge at the $42,786 price level. Overcoming this resistance is crucial for Bitcoin to regain stability and demonstrate potential for a recovery. However, the market currently lacks the necessary liquidity to facilitate a strong rebound, as trading volumes remain relatively low.

Shiba Inu gets hit
The token is currently trading at a local support level, which is a make-or-break situation for its short-term future. A breakdown below this point could spell trouble, signaling a potential decline and testing the resilience of its investor base.
The current market landscape for SHIB is challenging, with a noticeable lack of growth catalysts and low liquidity in the broader cryptocurrency market, both of which could exacerbate the asset's precarious position.

However, there is a glimmer of hope. The descending trading volume accompanying SHIB's price consolidation suggests that bearish momentum could be waning. This deceleration of selling pressure often precedes a stabilization of price, or even a reversal if bulls regain control.

In terms of specific price levels, SHIB is currently finding tentative support around the $0.000027 mark. Should this level fail to hold, the next support zone lies near $0.000022, which may serve as a new accumulation point for buyers. On the resistance side, SHIB faces a hurdle at $0.000035, a breach of which could open the door to a retest of higher levels, possibly around the $0.000040 range.

The recent price chart indicates a concerning situation: the 26-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a key indicator of short-term momentum, is under threat. If this level fails to hold, Ethereum could see its value dip to the $2,347 mark, a scenario that may well trigger a more pronounced decline.

This potential slip below the 26 EMA is crucial because it suggests a weakening in buying pressure and a shift in market sentiment from accumulation to potential distribution. A break below this level would not only establish $2,347 as the next price floor but could also exacerbate the asset's losses, leading to further bearish momentum.

ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewThe Ethereum ecosystem has faced its share of challenges despite the rise of layer 2-networks, which have not catalyzed the anticipated rally. The broader market has similarly not exhibited the explosive bull run many investors had hoped for, with Ethereum’s trajectory reflecting this subdued market energy.

Additional support and resistance zones can be gleaned from the chart. On the support side, following the $2,347 level, the next critical support lies around $2,175.2 - a breach of which could see ETH test the psychological and technical support near the $2,000 level. Resistance, on the other hand, is firmly established at the recent high of $2,547.6. This price point serves as a litmus test for Ethereum’s ability to rebound and reclaim bullish momentum.

The current market dynamics, marked by cautious trading and a lack of definitive direction, have placed Ethereum in a zone of uncertainty. Investors are advised to monitor these levels closely, as a break below or above these could signal Ethereum's next significant move.

Bitcoin in trouble
Bitcoin finds itself at a precarious juncture as it teeters on the edge of the critical $40,000 mark. The recent price action paints a troubling picture for Bitcoin enthusiasts, with the asset losing its grip on the 50-day Exponential Moving Average, a key support level that has historically indicated bullish sentiment.
As Bitcoin's price struggles to maintain the $40,000 level, the next potential foothold lies at the 100-day EMA. However, this level does not traditionally offer substantial support, and a breach below could precipitate a fall below $39,000, triggering heightened market concern. The chart reveals that the next major support zone stands near the $35,888 mark, a level that buyers might attempt to defend vigorously.

On the resistance front, Bitcoin faces a significant challenge at the $42,786 price level. Overcoming this resistance is crucial for Bitcoin to regain stability and demonstrate potential for a recovery. However, the market currently lacks the necessary liquidity to facilitate a strong rebound, as trading volumes remain relatively low.

Shiba Inu gets hit
The token is currently trading at a local support level, which is a make-or-break situation for its short-term future. A breakdown below this point could spell trouble, signaling a potential decline and testing the resilience of its investor base.

"Ethereum (ETH) Loses All of Its Gains, Bitcoin (BTC) Not Ready to Give up $40,000, Solana (SOL) Comeback Starts","U.Today - Ethereum has wiped out the gains it had accumulated over a sustained period. The ETH/USD price chart depicts a grim narrative as the digital asset has swiftly descended from its peak, retracing back to levels that question the sustainability of its prior growth.

The steep decline in Ethereum's price is a significant bearish signal. It reflects the market's hesitancy to invest at previous highs, most likely due to the underperformance Ethereum has shown in the recent past. This lack of traction and inability to initiate a recovery underscores the vulnerability of Ethereum's price in the current market climate.

ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewFocusing on the technical aspects, Ethereum has broken through what was once seen as a strong support level at approximately $2,350. This price point, which previously saw substantial buying interest, has now been breached, leading to a cascading effect as the asset searches for new support. The next critical support level is around $2,175, where buyers might emerge to stall the downfall.

Conversely, any attempts at recovery will first encounter resistance at around $2,338, a level that now marks the lower boundary of what was a consolidation range before the drop. A close above this level on significant volume could signal a temporary respite from selling pressure. However, the real test lies at higher resistance levels, previously established around $2,500, where ETH struggled to maintain upward momentum.

Bitcoin ready to fight
Recent candlestick formations portray a scenario where Bitcoin is flirting with a critical resistance level, poised to either confirm a bearish trend or start a substantial recovery.
The chart illustrates Bitcoin’s recent descent, as it lost its foothold at the higher price echelons it previously occupied. However, amid this downward movement, Bitcoin is showing signs of resilience. The latest candles indicate a potential reversal as they hover around a significant support level, which can be identified at approximately $37,000, a region where buyers have historically stepped in.

A sustained hold above this point could catalyze renewed buying interest, which may drive the price toward the immediate resistance level at around $41,000. The significance of reclaiming this threshold cannot be understated, as it may invalidate the bearish outlook and signal a trend reversal.

As for the upper resistances, the $43,000 and $46,000 price levels stand out as notable barriers that Bitcoin would need to breach to cement a robust recovery narrative. Achieving such milestones could sway market sentiment positively, potentially ushering in a wave of optimism among investors.

The moving averages offer additional insight, suggesting a possible bullish crossover should the current momentum persist. This scenario would be further supported by a rise in trading volume, which typically accompanies decisive trend shifts.

Solana among leaders
Solana shows signs of a nascent comeback, presenting a bullish scenario amid a broader market recovery. However, investors tread cautiously, aware of the potential of a ""dead cat bounce"" since volume profiles signal restraint.
Analyzing the SOL/USDT chart, we notice that Solana has established a local support level around the $70 price mark. This is characterized by multiple touches of this level over the past few weeks, each time resisting further downward movement.

On the flip side, the local resistance can be identified near the $96 level, which previously acted as support during Solana's consistent upward trend.

The price movement is currently sandwiched between the 50-day moving average acting as dynamic resistance and the 200-day moving average serving as potential dynamic support. The narrowing gap between these averages could squeeze the price action, possibly leading to a volatility breakout.

"XRP Starts Moving Earlier, Solana (SOL) Already Stronger Than Everyone Else; Does Ethereum (ETH) Need More Fuel?","U.Today - XRP appears to have begun its market movements earlier than anticipated. The chart shows a notable shift from the recent sideways trading pattern, as XRP starts to carve out a new direction.

As of the latest trends, XRP has been testing the support level around $0.50, a crucial psychological threshold for the asset. A sustained move below this level could signal further bearish momentum, potentially leading the price to test the next significant support zone around $0.47.

XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewOn the flip side, if XRP manages to stabilize and bounce back from the current support, the initial resistance is likely to be encountered near the $0.54 mark, where the 50-day moving average currently lies. This moving average has historically acted as a dynamic resistance level, and a breakout above could propel XRP toward the $0.56 level, which aligns with the 100-day moving average.

Further complicating the chart is the downward trendline that has been in play since the local high established in November. This trendline has repeatedly acted as resistance, pushing the price downward each time it has been tested. For a true reversal to be confirmed, XRP would need to break above this trendline with significant volume to validate the move.

Solana is leading pack
Solana is manifesting its strength as the top performer among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Despite overall market volatility, SOL's price action has been signaling a stronger recovery compared to other assets.
At the time of analysis, Solana is trading around the $90 mark, having rebounded with considerable momentum from the support level near $78.35. This pivotal point, bolstered by the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), has served as a springboard for the recent bullish trend. The price of SOL has been consistently creating higher lows, indicative of strong buying interest at these levels.

Resistance for SOL is currently looming at the $100 psychological level, a breakthrough of which could propel the price toward the next significant resistance at $110.

The relative strength of Solana is further substantiated by the resurgence of a risk appetite on the market, particularly evidenced by the blossoming of meme coins. This renewed interest in higher-risk assets typically bodes well for ecosystems like Solana that support a variety of decentralized applications and niche crypto projects.

Ethereum needs push
The Ethereum market is currently facing a confluence of challenges as it searches for the momentum to sustain its position. A recent chart analysis reveals an indecisive atmosphere among investors, with Ethereum struggling to find a strong directional move.
At present, Ethereum is hovering around the $2,200 mark, a level that has seen significant activity and is currently acting as a temporary support. However, the lack of bullish conviction suggests that this support level may not hold if a new wave of selling pressure emerges.

Resistance levels are observed near the $2,400 range, where previous attempts to break higher have been met with a firm rejection, indicating a substantial barrier to upward movement.

The selling pressure is partly attributed to the recent news of Celsius Network liquidating approximately $1 billion worth of Ethereum holdings. This substantial amount has the potential to saturate the market, overwhelming current liquidity and triggering a downturn. As a result, the $2,000 psychological level is eyed as the next critical support zone, a breach of which could see a sharp decline toward the $1,950 region, where the 200-day moving average lies, providing stronger historical support.

On the flip side, if Ethereum can absorb the selling pressure and gain the necessary ""fuel,"" a push above the $2,400 resistance could open the path toward the $2,500 area before challenging the more formidable resistance at $2,600, which aligns with the 50-day moving average.

"Dogecoin (DOGE) Breakout Occurs, What's Next? Solana (SOL) Stays Dominant, Will Ethereum (ETH) Survive Unseen Stalemate?","U.Today - Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency that started as a joke but became a favorite of the masses, including Elon Musk, has recently experienced a significant breakout.

After a period of consolidation, DOGE has broken past a critical resistance level, stirring excitement among traders and investors. The coin is currently sitting above the $0.088 mark, which previously acted as substantial resistance. If DOGE manages to maintain its position above this level, it could solidify this area as new support.

Dogecoin/USDT Chart by TradingViewA break above the $0.095 resistance could signal a continued bullish trend, potentially leading Dogecoin to test the psychological barrier of $0.10. If the momentum is sustained and market sentiment remains positive, DOGE could attempt to reach higher highs, possibly moving toward the $0.105 to $0.11 range last seen during its peak periods of trading activity.

Immediate support for DOGE is now at $0.088 which, if held, could act as a springboard for further climbs. However, should Dogecoin fail to maintain this level, it might fall back to its previous support near $0.078, where buyers have historically shown interest.

A scenario where DOGE's breakout continues would likely involve increased adoption news or a resurgence of interest in meme coins, potentially sparked by social media or celebrity endorsements. Such catalysts could drive demand and push DOGE past the $0.095 level, cementing its breakout status.

Conversely, if the breakout fails to sustain, perhaps due to broader market bearishness or fading interest, DOGE could slide back below $0.088. This would retest the resilience of the $0.078 support. A drop below this level could lead to a bearish phase, with DOGE potentially seeking lower ground.

Solana shows strength
During this market cycle, Solana has established itself as a leader. With its stable and easily scalable performance, it outpaces giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as the majority of DeFi volume went to the ""Ethereum killer.""
As the DeFi ecosystem on Solana flourishes, it is becoming a hub for innovation, blending meme culture with decentralized applications. The network's efficiency and scalability are attracting a wide array of developers.

The cryptocurrency that has been on a strong upward trajectory. Currently, Solana is testing a resistance level at approximately $100, a significant psychological and technical barrier. A convincing break above this level could signal continued bullish momentum, potentially leading to testing the next resistance zone around $108, which coincides with recent highs.

On the downside, the 50-day moving average, sitting near $93.23, is providing dynamic support. This level has been defended multiple times, indicating its importance to traders. If Solana can maintain its footing above this moving average, it would reinforce the asset's stability and could serve as a springboard for further gains.

The next crucial test for Solana will be sustaining above $100. Should it consolidate above this level, it would not be unrealistic to envision a push toward $108, or even higher, as the market reassesses Solana's value proposition in the context of a rapidly evolving DeFi and NFT landscape.

Fundamental Ethereum problems
As it struggles to gain momentum, Ethereum's scalability suffering and the diminishing traction of meme coins on its network are at the forefront of the bearish case for the second-biggest cryptocurrency on the market.
The network's inability to handle high transaction volumes without exorbitant fees has led to the sentiment that Ethereum is becoming ""unusable"" for the day-to-day transactions that meme coins require.

From a technical standpoint, Ethereum's price analysis paints a picture of uncertainty. The asset has been struggling to maintain momentum above crucial support levels. Currently, Ethereum is wavering around the $2,250 mark, with immediate support near the $2,150 level. A break below this support could see a decline toward the $2,000 psychological barrier, which would represent a significant bearish development.

Layer-2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum have emerged as potential stopgaps, offering faster and cheaper transactions. However, their adoption has been less than stellar, with many viewing these platforms as temporary fixes rather than a comprehensive solution to Ethereum's underlying scalability problems.

"Arbitrum (ARB) Rally Halted, Ethereum (ETH) Makes Important Reminder, Did Solana (SOL) Hit Ceiling?","U.Today - The leading layer-2 solution in the Ethereum ecosystem, Arbitrum, has recently seen a significant rally, but this has been interrupted, indicating a potential reversal in its price trajectory.

ARB's price movement had been bullish, as evidenced by its ascent past the moving averages, which served as dynamic support levels during its uptrend. However, the price has encountered substantial resistance, leading to a halt in its rally.

ARB/USDT Chart by TradingViewThe chart demonstrates ARB's struggle to maintain its upward momentum, with the token facing a critical resistance level at approximately $2.00. After failing to breach this threshold, ARB experienced a pullback, currently trading around $1.80.

The support levels to watch are strategically positioned at $1.68 and $1.47, which could provide a safety net for the price if the downward pressure persists. It may also find a stronger base at $1.32, a level that could be fundamental for buyers to reenter the market. Conversely, a bounce off the support could signal a potential for growth, with a retest of the $2.00 resistance level and possible breakout.

Ethereum shows some aggression
As the cryptocurrency market continues its dynamic ebb and flow, Ethereum (ETH) provides a salient reminder of its resilience and potential for growth. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has recently seen a reversal in its price, suggesting a potential shift in market sentiment and positioning.
The price analysis of Ethereum shows a significant level of activity around the $2,400 price point, suggesting this is a key resistance level. After a period of upward movement, ETH's price action indicates a halt and potential retracement from this level. This movement could be indicative of the market catching its breath after a period of accumulation.

Despite ETH's uptick in movement, it has not mirrored the performance of some of its contemporaries like Solana, or even Bitcoin. While these cryptocurrencies have seen more robust growth, Ethereum's progression appears more measured, possibly due to its already substantial market penetration and the maturation of its ecosystem.

The support levels for Ethereum stand firmly at around $2,197 and $2,033, which are crucial if Ethereum were to sustain a further drop in price. These levels may act as a springboard for price recovery should market conditions remain favorable. Conversely, the resistance level at approximately $2,400 is proving to be a formidable barrier to overcome.

The current technical outlook suggests Ethereum may indeed rally to test the $2,400 resistance level again. However, investors should be prepared for a possible retracement following this test. The interplay of support and resistance levels will be crucial in determining ETH's price trajectory in the short term.

Solana's rally on pause?
Solana has recently hit a metaphorical ceiling, as the fervor around the DeFi industry and meme coins that once propelled its value upward has begun to decline. This cooling on the NFT market has contributed to the deceleration in SOL's price momentum, as evidenced by the latest price charts.
A close analysis of the SOL price chart indicates a reversal from its upward trajectory, with the asset facing resistance at approximately $101. The resistance level has proven to be a formidable barrier, with Solana struggling to maintain the bullish momentum it had gained in the past.

Support levels for Solana are observed around the $94 and $76 marks. These levels may offer some respite to the asset’s price if the downward pressure continues. If Solana dips to these support levels and holds, it could signal the potential for recovery and another attempt to break through the current resistance.

Despite the recent slowdown, Solana has indeed had an impressive run. Its ecosystem continues to develop, and while the immediate future may not look as bright as it once did, the possibility of a rebound remains. The market’s cyclical nature and the potential for innovation within Solana’s platform could provide the necessary catalyst for another period of growth.

The support levels to watch are strategically positioned at $1.68 and $1.47, which could provide a safety net for the price if the downward pressure persists. It may also find a stronger base at $1.32, a level that could be fundamental for buyers to reenter the market. Conversely, a bounce off the support could signal a potential for growth, with a retest of the $2.00 resistance level and possible breakout.

Ethereum shows some aggression
As the cryptocurrency market continues its dynamic ebb and flow, Ethereum (ETH) provides a salient reminder of its resilience and potential for growth. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has recently seen a reversal in its price, suggesting a potential shift in market sentiment and positioning.
The price analysis of Ethereum shows a significant level of activity around the $2,400 price point, suggesting this is a key resistance level. After a period of upward movement, ETH's price action indicates a halt and potential retracement from this level. This movement could be indicative of the market catching its breath after a period of accumulation.

Despite ETH's uptick in movement, it has not mirrored the performance of some of its contemporaries like Solana, or even Bitcoin. While these cryptocurrencies have seen more robust growth, Ethereum's progression appears more measured, possibly due to its already substantial market penetration and the maturation of its ecosystem.

The support levels for Ethereum stand firmly at around $2,197 and $2,033, which are crucial if Ethereum were to sustain a further drop in price. These levels may act as a springboard for price recovery should market conditions remain favorable. Conversely, the resistance level at approximately $2,400 is proving to be a formidable barrier to overcome.

The current technical outlook suggests Ethereum may indeed rally to test the $2,400 resistance level again. However, investors should be prepared for a possible retracement following this test. The interplay of support and resistance levels will be crucial in determining ETH's price trajectory in the short term.

Solana's rally on pause?
Solana has recently hit a metaphorical ceiling, as the fervor around the DeFi industry and meme coins that once propelled its value upward has begun to decline. This cooling on the NFT market has contributed to the deceleration in SOL's price momentum, as evidenced by the latest price charts.
A close analysis of the SOL price chart indicates a reversal from its upward trajectory, with the asset facing resistance at approximately $101. The resistance level has proven to be a formidable barrier, with Solana struggling to maintain the bullish momentum it had gained in the past.

Support levels for Solana are observed around the $94 and $76 marks. These levels may offer some respite to the asset’s price if the downward pressure continues. If Solana dips to these support levels and holds, it could signal the potential for recovery and another attempt to break through the current resistance.

Despite the recent slowdown, Solana has indeed had an impressive run. Its ecosystem continues to develop, and while the immediate future may not look as bright as it once did, the possibility of a rebound remains. The market’s cyclical nature and the potential for innovation within Solana’s platform could provide the necessary catalyst for another period of growth.

"ChainLink (LINK) Price Explosion: What Happened? Ethereum (ETH) Price Rally Lacks Backbone, Can Bitcoin (BTC) Break Through 50 EMA?","U.Today - Chainlink has surged ahead of the rest of the crypto market with an explosive 16% rally in the last two days. This rally can be attributed to a variety of factors, not least of which is the activity spike in previously dormant wallets, signaling a resurgence of movement within the Chainlink ecosystem.

The analytics have revealed an Age Consumed spike of 5.38 billion, a metric that measures the multiplication of coins moved by the number of days they had remained passive. This sudden mobilization of LINK tokens has injected volatility and liquidity onto the market, fueling the price ascent.

LINK/USDT Chart by TradingViewFrom a technical standpoint, Chainlink's price has breached crucial resistance levels, now attempting to establish new support. The price has soared past the $15.29 mark, which previously acted as a significant resistance barrier. This breakthrough suggests robust bullish sentiment, with the potential for further growth if the momentum is sustained.

The next resistance lies at approximately $18.39, a level that, if conquered, could bolster confidence in Chainlink's uptrend. Conversely, should there be a retracement, the $14.29 level may serve as a new support, providing a safety net for the price. A dip below this could see LINK testing the $13.18 support zone, where buyers may step in to prop up the market.

No power for Ethereum
Ethereum, the second-largest decentralized network by market capitalization, is experiencing a period of stagnation, with its anticipated price rally showing signs of faltering. Despite Ethereum's prominence in the blockchain space, the network is seeing a significant challenge from competitors like Solana, which has been capturing a growing share of blockchain activity.
A closer look at Ethereum's price movement reveals a lack of momentum that could be attributed to the decrease in on-chain traction and volume. Ethereum's price is currently consolidating around the $2,300 mark, struggling to find the strength for a decisive move. The key resistance level to watch is at $2,337, where the token has faced repeated rejections. A breakthrough above this point could potentially lead to a test of the $2,450 zone, offering a glimmer of hope for bullish momentum.

However, the support levels paint a cautious picture, with $2,193 serving as the immediate floor. A breach below this could see prices slide toward the $2,042 level, which could further dampen market sentiment. The lack of volume accompanying recent price movements suggests a tentative market, with investors possibly waiting for a stronger sign of a trend reversal before committing to more substantial positions.

Bitcoin aims for breakthrough
Bitcoin has recently made a bold move, slicing through the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a key technical resistance level. This breakthrough is a sign of strength from the leading cryptocurrency, indicating a potential reversal from its recent price consolidation.
The 50 EMA has historically acted as a litmus test for Bitcoin's short-term trend direction. A sustained move above this line could validate bullish sentiment among investors, as the cryptocurrency tries to establish a new foothold for further gains. Currently, Bitcoin's price is hovering around the $42,000 mark, attempting to solidify its position above the 50 EMA.

In terms of price analysis, the successful breach of the 50 EMA has set the stage for Bitcoin to test the next resistance level near $43,500. This level is critical as a break above could pave the way for a move toward the $45,000 resistance zone. However, it is essential to note that Bitcoin needs to maintain its current momentum to prevent fallbacks below the 50 EMA, which could dampen the optimistic outlook.

Ethereum (ETH) Staking Ratio Surprisingly Keeps Surging Despite Shapella,"U.Today - Ki Young Ju, founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, leading on-chain analytical firm, shared his views on the Ethereum (ETH) staking progress. He admits he was wrong about Shapella hard fork's effects.

Ethereum (ETH) staking ratio surges to 24% and counting
Ethereum (ETH) staking ratio, i.e., the percentage of ETH coins locked in staking, reaches 24% and keeps surging. Meanwhile, only 11% of the ETH supply is stored on centralized exchanges. The data was shared by Ki Young Ju on X today, on Jan. 18, 2024.
As such, it is safe to say that the overhyped Ethereum (ETH) upgrade Shapella that allowed stakers to withdraw their coins for the first time since December 2020 did not result in massive unstaking:

Ethereum's (ETH) Shapella was activated in April 2023. As crypto markets were still dominated by bearish sentiment, analysts were expecting withdrawals and consecutive sell-offs of Ethereum (ETH).

The Ethereum (ETH) price also managed to go through this event without significant losses: as stakers withdrew 1 million Ethers (ETH) in first week post-Shapella, the ETH price was fluctuating between $2,000 and $2,100.

Staked Ethereums (ETH) are mostly profitable, Mr. Ki Young Ju adds. While the realized price for staking inflows is $2,014, the current ETH rate is $2,519. As such, the average Ether ""stake"" is being held with a significant 25% profit.

The aggregated volume of the Ethereum (ETH) staking ecosystem is estimated at a whopping $72 billion, with 4.25% in APY, Staking Rewards data says.

Сardano (ADA) staking close to surpassing Solana (SOL)
At the same time, the largest Ethereum (ETH) competitors might be close to a historic ""flippening."" The Solana (SOL) staking ratio is plummeting. The indicator lost over 20% in the last week and dipped below 67%.
Meanwhile, the Cardano (ADA) staking ecosystem added 0.06% in the last seven days and is getting closer to 64%. At the same time, the USD-denominated volume of Solana (SOL) staking is over 200% larger than that of Cardano (ADA).

Out of all mainstream altcoins, Mina Protocol (MINA) demonstrates the largest staking ratio: its stakers locked over 91% of the circulating supply.

Aptos (APT) and Sui (SUI) follow the Mina Protocol (MINA) with 85%-86% in staking ratio.

"Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin Makes Surprising Visit to Binance, SHIB Rep Shares Shibarium's Plans to Onboard Thousands of Projects: Crypto News Digest by U.Today","U.Today - Take a look at the most important crypto events with U.Today's top three news stories.

Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin makes surprising visit to Binance
As has been recently shared by Binance CEO Richard Teng on the X platform, Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin made a surprising visit to the Binance office. Teng thanked Buterin for finding time to speak to his team in person, saying that it was a privilege to have him in the company's office. This spontaneous visit caused quite a stir in the crypto community, with many users speculating about a potential collaboration between these two giants of the crypto market. As a reminder, Binance is currently struggling with a $4 billion fine and ongoing regulatory challenges; considering this, Buterin's focus (described in his essay entitled ""Make Ethereum Cypherpunk Again"") on security, privacy and scalability, and concern for centralized exchanges and their vulnerability to hacking, feed rumors about possible cooperation between Buterin and Binance. However, neither Buterin nor Teng made any statements in this regard.
Shibarium: Thousands of projects to join L2 network with numerous partnerships – SHIB rep
In a recent X post, Shiba Inu team member Lucie shared Shibarium's plans for the future. Lucie wrote that the layer-2 solution aims to ""onboard 1,000 projects with numerous partnerships,"" reminding the community that supporting new projects does not necessarily mean canceling existing ones. The SHIB representative then called on all meme token supporters to stay strong as a community during challenging times, stating that there is hardly any point in giving up now if they got ""this far"" in their support for the project's team. Lucie's post has evoked mixed reactions among SHIB army members; even though many of them praised the SHIB developers, some users questioned the project team's ability to accomplish anything more than just making plans and promising new advances.
JPMorgan: Bitcoin ETF hype cooling
According to Kenneth Worthington, analyst at JPMorgan, the initial enthusiasm surrounding Bitcoin ETFs may be waning, with a shift toward a ""more normalized flow environment"" being potentially on the horizon. On Jan. 26, spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced net sales of about $15 million following a four-day streak of redemptions. This reversal could be an indication of changing investor sentiment on these novel financial products. Since their launch, the Bitcoin price has plunged by about 9% but has since stabilized around $42,000 as the new trading week gets underway. Previously, JPMorgan correctly predicted that the approval of Bitcoin ETFs would be a sell-the-news event. Before the approval, the price of the leading cryptocurrency dropped from above $47,000 to below $39,000. The sell-off coincided with large outflows from Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which transitioned into a spot Bitcoin ETF after the SEC's approval.

"Here's Who Burned 9,001 ETH in Last 30 Days","U.Today - Uniswap, the world’s largest decentralized exchange, is apparently a top burner of Ethereum, with a staggering 9,001 ETH incinerated from the circulating supply in the last 30 days. This activity firmly positions Uniswap as a key player in the Ethereum ecosystem, not just in terms of volume but also in influencing the coin's scarcity.

The mechanism behind Ethereum's burn is a recent upgrade known as EIP-1559, which introduced a transaction fee burn for every operation made on the network. Uniswap, as the leading DEX, handles a massive volume of transactions, naturally leading to a higher rate of ETH being burned. This burn acts as a deflationary force on the supply of Ethereum, theoretically creating scarcity that could bolster the asset's value over the long term.

ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewHowever, the correlation between burn rate and immediate price action is not linear. While Uniswap's significant contribution to the burn rate underscores its dominance, the short-term impact on Ethereum’s price is subdued. Over a longer horizon, this deflationary mechanism is expected to establish a supportive base for the price of ETH, as reducing supply, ceteris paribus, should increase the value of each remaining ETH.

It is important to note, though, that scarcity alone does not guarantee value growth. The intrinsic value of Ethereum also hinges on its utility, adoption and broader market sentiment. Currently, Ethereum is facing stiff competition from Solana in ecosystem growth, with many traders who favor volatility and risk gravitating toward Solana.

A technical analysis of Ethereum's current price action shows a challenging market phase. Ethereum is attempting to hold support around the $2,400 level. Should it fail to sustain this, the next key support is observed at the $2,300 mark, near the 50-day EMA. A breach below this could see Ethereum test the $2,000 psychological support level. Conversely, if Ethereum can rally past the immediate resistance at $2,500, it could pave the way to retest previous highs near $2,800.

Vitalik Buterin Answers Major Bitcoin and Ethereum Question in Birthday Essay,"U.Today - Renowned Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin celebrated his 30 birthday today by releasing a thoughtful essay titled ""The End of My Childhood."" The essay delves into the genesis of cryptocurrencies, and Bitcoin in particular, underscoring its initial purpose as a response to the vulnerabilities of traditional banking systems.

In his reflective piece, Buterin questions the evolution of public discourse within the crypto space over the past 15 years, pondering whether the original narrative emphasizing financial disruption has waned. To address this, he proposes two pragmatic approaches for the crypto ecosystem.

First, Buterin advocates for a renewed emphasis on the significance of money and finance, urging the crypto space to actively contribute to serving underserved populations and fostering financial inclusion. Second, he envisions a broader role for crypto that extends beyond finance.

Highlighting the unique decentralized nature of the crypto industry, Buterin notes that developers are dispersed globally, and many major crypto projects are not bound by geographical constraints. He emphasizes the potential of non-Western developers to understand and address the concrete needs of users in low-income countries.

Ideal reality by Vitalik Buterin
Buterin's vision for Ethereum goes beyond financial applications. He envisions ETH as the foundation for a decentralized tech stack, emphasizing trustworthiness, democracy and privacy. Zero-knowledge proofs are identified as a key innovation in achieving these goals, offering a nuanced approach to issues of authenticity, manipulation and privacy.
Source: ""The end of my childhood"" by Vitalik ButerinIn addition to Ethereum's role as a financial platform, Buterin encourages the community to broaden its focus, positioning his brainchild as a competitive force against centralized tech companies.

The essay articulates a nuanced perspective on the roles of token holders, intellectuals, builders and pragmatic users within the crypto ecosystem, highlighting the need for collaboration and understanding between these groups.

In his reflective piece, Buterin questions the evolution of public discourse within the crypto space over the past 15 years, pondering whether the original narrative emphasizing financial disruption has waned. To address this, he proposes two pragmatic approaches for the crypto ecosystem.

First, Buterin advocates for a renewed emphasis on the significance of money and finance, urging the crypto space to actively contribute to serving underserved populations and fostering financial inclusion. Second, he envisions a broader role for crypto that extends beyond finance.

Highlighting the unique decentralized nature of the crypto industry, Buterin notes that developers are dispersed globally, and many major crypto projects are not bound by geographical constraints. He emphasizes the potential of non-Western developers to understand and address the concrete needs of users in low-income countries.

Ideal reality by Vitalik Buterin
Buterin's vision for Ethereum goes beyond financial applications. He envisions ETH as the foundation for a decentralized tech stack, emphasizing trustworthiness, democracy and privacy. Zero-knowledge proofs are identified as a key innovation in achieving these goals, offering a nuanced approach to issues of authenticity, manipulation and privacy.

Bitcoin and Ethereum Bulls Taking Control: $60 Million of Shorts Liquidated Ahead of Weekend,"U.Today - The cryptocurrency market is witnessing a strong bullish momentum as Bitcoin and Ethereum bulls start to assert control. In a significant development, shorts worth approximately $60 million have been liquidated, signaling a potential shift in market sentiment as we approach the weekend.

Analyzing the current charts, Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience, managing to sustain above the crucial support level of $40,000. The coin has recently experienced a rebound from this level, which has historically acted as a strong psychological barrier for both bulls and bears.

Source: CoinglassIf BTC maintains its position above this support, the next key resistance to watch will be around $42,000, a level where we might expect some consolidation before a further push. On the downside, if the $40,000 level fails to hold, traders should look for potential support near the $38,500 region.

Ethereum, on the other hand, is also showing signs of recovery after a recent sell-off. The coin has found support near the $2,100 mark, just above the 200-day exponential moving average, which is often considered a significant indicator of long-term trends.

If ETH can sustain this rebound, the immediate resistance is expected at $2,400. A breakthrough above this could open the path toward $2,500, a level that previously acted as both support and resistance. A fall below the current support level could see the price testing the next support zone around $2,000.

The liquidation heatmap provides additional context, illustrating the pressure on short sellers as the market moves against their positions. This liquidation is particularly evident in the case of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have seen a significant number of short positions being closed in a short span of time. Overall, the market is currently displaying bullish signs, with strong support levels holding up.

Ethereum (ETH) Needs These 3 Crucial Factors to Align for Growth: Details,"U.Today - Despite Ethereum's position as a frontrunner in the altcoin sector, its growth has been stunted by a bearish trend that has held a tight grip on the market in recent weeks. A closer look at the ETH chart reveals that the expected volatility spike that could catalyze a bullish reversal has yet to materialize.

Layer-2 network adoption and ecosystem expansion
First, the surge of layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism could be a catalyst for Ethereum's growth. These networks aim to enhance Ethereum's ecosystem by providing the much-needed scalability and reduced fees, potentially driving renewed interest and increased adoption of the Ethereum network.
ETH/USD Chart by TradingView

Scalability and network efficiency
Second, Ethereum's persistent scalability issues must be addressed. Despite the implementation of EIP-1559, which was anticipated to make transaction fees more predictable, the network still struggles under high demand, leading to exorbitant fees and reduced network functionality. Resolving these scalability woes is crucial, as a more efficient and cost-effective network is vital for Ethereum to retain its value and utility.
Introduction of Ethereum ETF
Finally, the establishment of an Ethereum ETF would be a strong bullish signal, mirroring the impact of the Bitcoin ETF. An Ethereum ETF would pave the way for institutional investment, providing a regulated and accessible means for traditional investors to gain exposure to ETH. This could secure Ethereum's future as a mainstream financial asset and provide a stable foundation for long-term growth.
Looking at the Ethereum chart, we identify a local resistance level at approximately $2433.5, a price point that has acted as a hurdle in recent trading sessions. For a bullish case to solidify, Ethereum needs to break past this resistance with conviction. Should this occur, it could signal a shift in investor sentiment and open the path to higher price levels.

Self-Proclaimed Satoshi Craig Wright Takes Dig at Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin,"U.Today - In an unexpected turn of events today, self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto Craig Wright took a swipe at Ethereum's creator, Vitalik Buterin. Wright revisited a series of posts by Buterin in 2017, where he discussed the early versions of the Ethereum protocol.

Back then, Buterin had responded to a question about the possibility of building Ethereum on top of Bitcoin, expressing concerns about potential conflicts with Bitcoin's development team. He cited fears that protocol rules might change, making it difficult for him to build on a base protocol at odds with his vision.

Fast forward to January 2024, and Wright seized the opportunity to comment on Buterin's past remarks. He argued that Ethereum only exists due to centralized development teams that have the power to alter the protocol. Wright mused about the hypothetical scenario of having everything built on Bitcoin, envisioning a more streamlined and less fragmented system.

Bitcoin v. Ethereum
Wright's comments add fuel to the longstanding rivalry between Bitcoin and Ethereum, highlighting fundamental differences in their approaches to decentralization and protocol governance.
While Ethereum has achieved considerable success as a platform for smart contracts and applications, Wright argues for the stability and originality of Bitcoin's protocol.

Moreover, it revives the centralization debate in both cryptocurrency ecosystems. On the one side is OFAC's censorship of ETH transactions; on the other side is the enormous concentration of BTC in the hands of whales and miners.

"Samson Mow Takes Subtle Jab at Ethereum (ETH), Is XRP Next?","U.Today - Samson Mow, the chief executive officer of investment firm Jan3 and prominent Bitcoin (BTC) bull and evangelist, has taken his advocacy for the top coin to a new level. In his latest post on X, he took a subtle jab at alternative investment assets, including Silver and Ethereum (ETH), as his way of reducing their viability in comparison to their counterparts Gold and Silver.

Samson Mow analogy
According to Samson Mow, Silver is the poor man’s Gold, a statement that shows that investors who consider the latter to be too expensive typically opt in for the former. While both are respected metals and investment assets, Gold is still considered the superior of the two.
Samson Mow deflated Ethereum’s ego to end the long-standing superiority debate with Bitcoin. The vocal investor noted that ""Ethereum is the stupid man's Bitcoin,"" a statement that spooked members of the ETH community.

By valuation, Bitcoin’s market cap currently stands at $809,923,408,001, while that of Ethereum comes in at $297,575,053,741. The price differentials of $41,344.01 to $2,476.66 also show that Bitcoin is the most valuable of the two. Over time, there have been conversations about shifting capital from BTC to ETH, a trend that might be amplified in the coming months if Ethereum’s key fundamentals come into play.

The harsh criticism of Ethereum did not go down well with its community members, with some pointing out the key improvements the protocol has made as a blockchain in itself.

Is XRP next?
As a Bitcoin Maxi, Samson Mow was asked by one of the commenters on his post what he thinks about XRP if Ethereum is the poor man’s Bitcoin. He simply answered that the demand is a ""tricky one.""
Samson Mow’s confidence in Bitcoin has made him forecast a $1 million price target, and his lack of confidence in XRP and Ethereum has undoubtedly made his bearish stand subtle.

Ethereum (ETH) Faces Serious Bug; Here's Who Might Be Affected,"U.Today - Ethereum is potentially facing a significant bug that has emerged, previously only assumed as a hypothetical scenario in discussions among the developer and validator community back in March 2022, but now it looms as a potential threat that could become a reality.

This bug concerns the Ethereum staking mechanism and how the network reaches consensus. In essence, if a majority client, holding more than 2/3 of the stake, has a bug, it could inadvertently build an invalid chain that the network would consider finalized due to the majority stake's ""agreement.""

If validators running this buggy client commit to this incorrect chain, any attempt to switch to a correct chain could result in severe penalties due to how the Ethereum protocol is designed to penalize what it sees as ""equivocating"" validators.

What makes this situation particularly alarming is the scale of the potential impact. If this bug manifests, the validators could find themselves in a predicament where they either continue to support an incorrect chain or switch to a correct one at great personal cost. The validators running the buggy client would face a dilemma: lose their stake through penalties or persist with an invalid chain, endangering the network's integrity.

For the average Ethereum holder not involved in staking or blockchain development, this might seem distant, but the implications can be far-reaching. An individual commented that the situation is ""pretty scary,"" and it is also the main reason why they do not stake any ETH. This sentiment reflects a potentially surging concern among holders who fear the ripple effects a bug of this magnitude could have on the network's trust and stability.

Centralized exchanges (CEXes), although well capitalized, might also feel the effect of potential finalization issues. Though their liquidity is far more resilient, mitigating large losses might still become an issue.

"Ethereum Whale Moves $46 Million in ETH Across Binance, Bitfinex and Aave: Details","U.Today - In a surprising move that has captured the attention of the cryptocurrency community, an Ethereum (ETH) whale has orchestrated a series of transactions involving major exchanges, moving a staggering $46.02 million in ETH over the past two days. The entity, utilizing a network of eight wallets, withdrew funds from Binance and Bitfinex before staking with Lido, a liquid staking solution.

Blockchain analytics platform Spot On Chain first brought attention to the substantial transactions through a tweet, revealing intricate details of the massive ETH movement. The whale withdrew the Ethereum holdings from crypto exchanges Binance and Bitfinex at an average price of approximately $2,419.

Subsequently, five wallets were employed to withdraw 50.15 million USDT from Aave, a prominent DeFi protocol, to the CEX trading platform, exchanging the stablecoin for 19,021 ETH, equivalent to the $46.02 million value. Spot On Chain further disclosed that three wallets still retained around 30 million USDT in Aave, sparking speculation that they might deposit these funds into a CEX soon, potentially acquiring more ETH.

Ethereum price struggles
The timing of these transactions coincided with a challenging period for the Ethereum market. At the time of the whale's activity, the price of ETH struggled, recording a 4.57% dip in the last 24 hours and a 9.46% decline in the past week. Current market data indicates ETH trading at $2,296.
Coinglass, another analytics platform, reported a significant amount of liquidations for ETH within the last 24 hours, totaling $53.78 million. Of this amount, $47.48 million resulted from long liquidations, while short liquidations accounted for $6.29 million. The liquidation data underscores the volatility and uncertainty prevalent on the market, with traders experiencing significant losses.

Market analysts and enthusiasts are closely monitoring these developments, as such large-scale transactions from influential entities often lead to speculation and conjecture regarding potential market impacts. Traders and investors are advised to exercise caution and stay vigilant as the cryptocurrency landscape continues to unfold, revealing the dynamics of this rapidly evolving market.

Ethereum (ETH) Becomes Target of Massive $1 Billion Sell-Off: Who's Responsible?,"U.Today - Ethereum is encountering a massive sell-off exceeding $1 billion. The source of this enormous market movement can be traced back to Celsius, which reportedly transferred a staggering 459,561 ETH, valued at approximately $1.014 billion, to various exchanges.

The distribution of this sell-off was as follows: 297,454 ETH ($656.5 million) moved to Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) Prime, 146,507 ETH to Paxos Treasury and smaller amounts of 7,800 ETH each, totaling $17.2 million, were transferred to FalconX and Coinbase. Despite this massive transfer, Celsius reportedly retains a reserve of 62,468 ETH, worth around $139 million.

Such a colossal sale exerts immense pressure on Ethereum's price and could significantly sway market sentiment. The immediate concern for investors and traders is whether Ethereum's liquidity and market capitalization can absorb such a hit without triggering a broad market downturn.

From a technical analysis standpoint, the massive outflow from Celsius is a bearish signal, likely to test Ethereum's local support levels. A crucial support to watch is around the $2,000 price range, a psychological and technical support level, which, if breached, could see the price tumble to the next significant support at $1,800. This level has historically acted as a strong buy zone and may serve as a robust defense against further declines.

Conversely, resistance levels have become more formidable due to the sell-off. Any potential recovery will have to confront the resistance at $2,200, which previously acted as a support level. A break above this could see Ethereum attempt to reclaim higher price levels, possibly testing the $2,400 resistance.

The substantial sell-off initiated by Celsius has placed Ethereum in a problematic position. Although the Ethereum network's fundamentals remain robust, the asset's price resilience in the face of such a significant sell-off shows the actual state of the market.

$13 Milion in Ethereum (ETH) Destroyed as Supply Becomes Deflationary Again,"U.Today - The recent data from Ethereum network indicates that the supply of Ethereum has once again entered a deflationary phase. Over the past 30 days, a striking $13 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) has been destroyed, with the net supply change showing a decrease of 5,619.39 ETH. This deflationary pressure is due to the network's burning mechanism, which has incinerated 74,933.24 ETH, outstripping the 69,313.86 ETH issued in the same period.

The implications of this deflationary trend could signal an approaching rally for Ethereum. A deflationary supply inherently suggests that the available quantity of ETH is decreasing, which could lead to an increase in value per token, assuming demand stays the same or grows. This dynamic, combined with the Ethereum network's continuous development and adoption, may set the stage for a bullish scenario.

ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewAnalyzing the Ethereum chart, a crucial factor is the potential breakthrough of the 50-day Exponential Moving Average. Currently, Ethereum hovers just below this significant level, and a break above could confirm a shift in market sentiment, potentially igniting upward price movement.

However, it is essential to acknowledge that Ethereum's current market traction is relatively muted. Despite the burn and the deflationary state of supply, the lack of significant network activity or groundbreaking updates has kept the token from gaining substantial momentum. Even activities by Ethereum's cofounder, Vitalik Buterin, which have historically influenced the market, seem to provide only a moderate push at best, under current conditions.

The market awaits a catalyst that could reignite Ethereum's dominance in the blockchain space. While the reduction in supply is a positive sign, without an accompanying increase in demand or network utility, the impact on price may be limited.

This deflationary pressure is due to the network's burning mechanism, which has incinerated 74,933.24 ETH, outstripping the 69,313.86 ETH issued in the same period.

The implications of this deflationary trend could signal an approaching rally for Ethereum. A deflationary supply inherently suggests that the available quantity of ETH is decreasing, which could lead to an increase in value per token, assuming demand stays the same or grows. This dynamic, combined with the Ethereum network's continuous development and adoption, may set the stage for a bullish scenario.

ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewAnalyzing the Ethereum chart, a crucial factor is the potential breakthrough of the 50-day Exponential Moving Average. Currently, Ethereum hovers just below this significant level, and a break above could confirm a shift in market sentiment, potentially igniting upward price movement.

However, it is essential to acknowledge that Ethereum's current market traction is relatively muted. Despite the burn and the deflationary state of supply, the lack of significant network activity or groundbreaking updates has kept the token from gaining substantial momentum. Even activities by Ethereum's cofounder, Vitalik Buterin, which have historically influenced the market, seem to provide only a moderate push at best, under current conditions.

The market awaits a catalyst that could reignite Ethereum's dominance in the blockchain space. While the reduction in supply is a positive sign, without an accompanying increase in demand or network utility, the impact on price may be limited.

Ethereum Closer to Epic Rebranding as Sepolia Welcomes Dencun Upgrade,"U.Today - The Ethereum blockchain is on its way to a massive rebranding as its long-awaited Dencun upgrade is now live on the Sepolia testnet. The Ethereum Foundation projected that the Dencun upgrade would launch on Sepolia by Jan. 30, and the successful integration was revealed by core developer Terrence.eth, for which he received many accolades from the community.

The Dencun upgrade going live on Sepolia is one of the two remaining steps required to launch the update on the Ethereum mainnet. Ethereum has long been plagued with lower scalability and high gas fees. For this, it has continued to receive intense backlash from industry analysts like legendary trader Peter Brandt, who considers its high cost of operation a basis for its demise in the long term.

The Dencun upgrade will attempt to resolve scalability issues while also making Ethereum more cost-effective as a protocol. The Dencun upgrade will specifically introduce proto-danksharding, a compressed data storage mechanism dubbed ""blobs"" to help optimize performance.

Development efforts are now in their advanced stages as the upgrade was launched on the Goerli testnet earlier this month. The last step before the mainnet debut will be to launch on the Holesky testnet, an upgrade that is scheduled for Feb. 7.

Ethereum to fight back against its competitors
Many new protocols have emerged to capitalize on the weakness of the Ethereum protocol. From Solana (SOL) to Cardano (ADA) and even Avalanche (AVAX), the race to dethrone Ethereum remains the core mantra for many developers in the Web3 ecosystem today.
With the Dencun upgrade, many of the pain points on Ethereum can be resolved, thus making the protocol more attractive to developers and end users overall. With the upgrade, Ethereum is poised to extend its dominance as the top blockchain of choice for all things decentralized finance (DeFi) and more.

Major FED Decision to Affect Crypto Market in Two Days,"U.Today - The crypto market is bracing itself as the Federal Reserve gears up to announce its first interest rate decision of 2024. The whispers from the CME about a 96.9% chance to keep interest rates unchanged are causing ripples. Yet, with the second decision in March casting a 47% shadow of a rate cut by 25 basis points (bps), investors are on edge. Adding to the economic fervor, the United States is set to release the January unemployment rate, which could further sway market sentiment.

The Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates is a critical economic lever that traditionally influences traditional markets and, as has been seen, the cryptocurrency market as well. An unchanged interest rate could maintain the status quo, possibly keeping investment steady in assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

A cut, however, could signal economic caution, potentially reducing the attractiveness of risk assets like cryptocurrencies or, conversely, could lead investors to seek higher returns in the crypto market if traditional investments falter.

BTC/USD Chart by TradingViewAnalyzing the Bitcoin chart, there is a distinctive ""war"" between the bulls and bears. The immediate resistance level to watch is around the $42,500 mark, which Bitcoin has been testing recently. This level is crucial because a decisive close above it could signal increasing bullish momentum. On the downside, the support level at approximately $39,528, aligning with a psychological round number and a previous area of interest, is one that traders are likely to defend vigorously.

The upcoming Fed decision could serve as a catalyst for Bitcoin's next big move. If interest rates remain unchanged, Bitcoin could continue to test the resistance level, and a break above could confirm a bullish reversal. However, should rates decrease, Bitcoin's reaction might be even more unpredictable.

"Shiba Inu (SHIB) Rapidly Breaks Down, Ethereum (ETH) Loses Traction, While Solana (SOL) Presents Hidden Opportunity","U.Today - Shiba Inu has experienced a significant breakdown from its recent consolidation phase. The chart depicts a clear downward trajectory as SHIB failed to maintain its position within the ascending triangle pattern it had formed over the past few months.

The breakdown was signaled as SHIB prices breached the key support level at $0.000009, which had previously acted as a reliable floor for the price during consolidation phases. Following this, SHIB prices tumbled further, slicing through subsequent support near $0.0000087. This price action marked a decisive shift in market sentiment from accumulation to distribution.

SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewThe next support level to watch is at $0.0000082, where SHIB may find a temporary reprieve from the selling pressure. If this level fails to hold, the next critical support lies at $0.0000076, which could serve as the last line of defense before a more significant drop.

For a reversal to occur and for SHIB to regain its upward momentum, it would need to reclaim previous support levels and transform them back into supports. This would require a substantial influx of buying pressure, potentially sparked by positive developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem or broader cryptocurrency market rallies.

The first sign of a possible reversal would be a return above $0.0000087, followed by a sustained move above the $0.000009 price level. A breakout above these levels, accompanied by increasing volume, could indicate that the downtrend is losing steam and that bulls are regaining control.

Solana paints reversal pattern
Solana has been developing a subtle yet potentially pivotal chart pattern. The asset has been tracing a slow and steady ascending channel, a formation that suggests a controlled and consistent uptrend. This pattern, characterized by higher lows and higher highs contained within two parallel trendlines, speaks to potential for continued growth.
The significance of this pattern lies in the momentum it could provide for SOL. Should the price action remain strong within the upper half of the channel, and particularly if it challenges the upper trendline, we could see Solana break through and embark on a more aggressive rally.

Such a bullish scenario would likely be supported by increased trading volume and positive developments within the Solana ecosystem, such as new project launches or updates that enhance network performance.

The immediate local resistance stands at around $55, and a confident push beyond this could confirm bullish sentiment. Inversely, if Solana's price dips below the channel's lower boundary, around $48, it could indicate that a bearish narrative is taking hold.

Ethereum momentum decreasing
Ethereum is exhibiting signs of waning momentum, as observed in recent price movements. The asset, which has long been considered the backbone of the decentralized finance sector, is facing a pivotal moment that could determine its trajectory for the coming weeks.
The provided chart illustrates Ethereum's struggle to maintain its grasp on the market. The price has been on a downward trend, edging closer to the local 26-day Exponential Moving Average. This level, currently near $2,465, is critical; if Ethereum fails to hold this line, we might see it descend to test the more significant 50 EMA, which stands around the $2,300 mark.

The 26 EMA serves as a short-term sentiment gauge, and its breach could signal a lack of immediate bullish support. Should this level fail to act as a springboard for price recovery, Ethereum's next stop could indeed be the 50 EMA. A breach below this longer-term moving average could potentially open the gates for a test of lower support levels, highlighting the need for investors to brace for more volatility.

Market participants are now recalibrating their expectations, understanding that the road to sustainable gains is a long-term journey.

"XRP's Epic Battle Against Bears, Solana Breaks $100, While Ethereum Fights for Momentum","U.Today - XRP is currently locked in a fierce struggle with bearish forces. The digital asset, which operates within the Ripple network, is experiencing difficulty establishing a position above a critical technical indicator — the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).

The 200 EMA serves as an important barometer for the long-term trend and investor sentiment. For XRP, remaining below this level suggests that the asset lacks the bullish momentum needed to shift into an upward trajectory. This inability to secure a foothold above the 200 EMA raises questions about the stability of positive price action in the near term.

XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewTechnical analysis shows that the 200 EMA is a dynamic level of resistance that many traders watch closely. A consistent failure to breach this mark can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy where the resistance level grows stronger, as more traders set their sell orders around this key price point.

Ethereum keeps on struggling
Ethereum is showing signs of losing its upward momentum, failing to form a higher high — an indicator that market experts often interpret as a sign of an impending price correction.
The ETH chart reveals a telling pattern; the absence of a new higher high is significant. Typically, in a bullish market phase, the price of an asset creates a series of higher highs and higher lows. However, Ethereum's inability to push beyond its recent peak may suggest that the bulls are running out of steam and a reevaluation of market sentiment could be underway.

Analyzing the chart, the local resistance level has been a tough ceiling for Ethereum to break. This resistance, where sell orders tend to cluster, is acting as a barrier preventing further upward movement. On the flip side, the support level represents a price point with a concentration of buy orders, offering a potential cushion against a price drop. If Ethereum fails to uphold the support level, it could trigger a price breakdown, signaling a shift to a bearish trend.

If Ethereum's price continues to struggle, the scenario could unfold where the asset drops further, testing subsequent support levels. While the underlying fundamentals of Ethereum, such as network upgrades and adoption rates, remain robust, the short-term price action could still be subject to corrective forces.

Solana wants another round
The battleground of volatility on the crypto market continues, and Solana (SOL) has not been spared from its whims. Once a darling of the crypto world for its speed and efficiency, SOL has recently been up against a wall, struggling to surpass the crucial $100 mark. The price chart reflects a narrative of struggle and resistance, painting a picture of an asset in need of momentum.
The technical outlook for SOL is looking promising. After a period of bullish activity that piqued the interest of many investors, SOL has hit a snag near the $100 resistance level. This resistance level represents a significant psychological and financial barrier, as it is where sell orders tend to accumulate, putting downward pressure on the price.

Despite efforts to rally, the asset has been unable to generate the necessary momentum to overcome this threshold with ease and currently consolidates at it. One of the key factors influencing this lackluster performance could be the market's tepid reaction to the announcement of Solana phone Saga 2. The news, which might have been expected to inject some enthusiasm onto the market, failed to provide substantial support for Solana's price.

Looking at the chart, the local support levels are clearly delineated. The first line of defense for SOL lies around the $88-$90 price range, where previous dips have found buyers waiting. Should this level fail to hold, the next support may not emerge until it reaches the more robust $70 level, which could act as a stronger foothold for the price.

Conversely, resistance beyond $100 is now more formidable than ever. With each rejection, the resolve of buyers weakens, and the $100 level transforms from a mere price point into a crucial psychological level you should not miss.

"Shiba Inu (SHIB) Becoming Bullish, Ethereum (ETH) Price Screams Rally Continuation, Bitcoin (BTC) Not Giving up Market Dominance","U.Today - Shiba Inu currently displays an ascending triangle pattern on the SHIB/USDT chart. This technical formation is widely recognized and could be a signal to a significant price surge for the meme.

An ascending triangle is characterized by a flat upper resistance line and a rising lower support line. This pattern suggests that buyers are gradually gaining ground against sellers, as each dip is bought up at a higher level than the previous one, indicating accumulating pressure for an upward breakout.

SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewFor Shiba Inu, which has been lingering in a period of relatively nonexistent activity, this pattern could serve as massive fuel for volatility in the near future. Recent market conditions have seen a decline in interest toward legacy meme coins, with SHIB being no exception. The lack of significant developments within the Shiba Inu network has contributed to the muted activity around this cryptocurrency.

In contrast, the majority of the action in the meme coin sector has been taking place on the Solana network. This platform has become a hotbed for the deployment of new meme coins, which are exhibiting far greater volatility than those on the Ethereum network, where Shiba Inu resides. The brisk activity on Solana contrasts sharply with the sluggishness observed in Ethereum's meme coin space, drawing in traders and investors looking for quick gains and high excitement.

Ethereum's correction is temporary
The Ethereum market is currently exhibiting a correction, and there are patterns that suggest a rally may not only be on the horizon but could also be in continuation. The asset has recently experienced a sharp downturn, movement that is readily apparent on intraday timeframes. However, such stark movements are often precursors to reversals, signaling that Ethereum could be gearing up for an upswing.
A closer look at the charts shows Ethereum's price action respecting a series of key technical indicators which, together, build a case for potential upward momentum. The asset has been tracing back to touch base with its moving averages, a behavior that is typically followed by a rebound, as these levels can act as dynamic support zones.

This corrective phase is noteworthy, especially considering the robust rally Ethereum enjoyed in the preceding weeks. Corrections are a natural and healthy part of any asset's price trajectory, allowing for consolidation before the next leg up. For Ethereum, the current pullback could be shaking out weak hands, setting the stage for a stronger rally propelled by a more committed investor base.

Bitcoin's dominance not going anywhere
After a brief breach below the 50-day EMA — a critical indicator of medium-term market sentiment — Bitcoin has clawed its way back above this pivotal level. This move indicates a bullish signal for market observers, suggesting that Bitcoin is not yet ready to relinquish its market dominance.
However, the ascent above the 50 EMA has not been met with the kind of vigorous momentum that bulls would hope for. The growth has been moderate, hinting that Bitcoin might encounter selling pressure as it ascends. This is not unusual on the crypto markets, where significant moves often face immediate resistance as traders take profits and skeptics cast doubts.

The recent price action has been a roller coaster for Bitcoin, which saw its value tumble from highs around $47,000 to lows near $41,000. This downturn briefly shifted the spotlight to altcoins, which seized the moment to stage local rallies. The diversification of gains across the crypto spectrum during Bitcoin's periods of weakness is a trend that has become more pronounced as the overall market matures.

Yet Bitcoin's ability to push back above the 50 EMA serves as a reminder of its underlying strength and the confidence investors have placed in it. Despite the opportunity for altcoins to rise, Bitcoin remains the anchor of the crypto market, with its moves often dictating broader market sentiment. This recent rebound above a crucial technical level could be interpreted as Bitcoin's silent assertion that it is not ready to give up the throne just yet.

"Ethereum (ETH) Loses All of Its Gains, Bitcoin (BTC) Not Ready to Give up $40,000, Solana (SOL) Comeback Starts","U.Today - Ethereum has wiped out the gains it had accumulated over a sustained period. The ETH/USD price chart depicts a grim narrative as the digital asset has swiftly descended from its peak, retracing back to levels that question the sustainability of its prior growth.

The steep decline in Ethereum's price is a significant bearish signal. It reflects the market's hesitancy to invest at previous highs, most likely due to the underperformance Ethereum has shown in the recent past. This lack of traction and inability to initiate a recovery underscores the vulnerability of Ethereum's price in the current market climate.

ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewFocusing on the technical aspects, Ethereum has broken through what was once seen as a strong support level at approximately $2,350. This price point, which previously saw substantial buying interest, has now been breached, leading to a cascading effect as the asset searches for new support. The next critical support level is around $2,175, where buyers might emerge to stall the downfall.

Conversely, any attempts at recovery will first encounter resistance at around $2,338, a level that now marks the lower boundary of what was a consolidation range before the drop. A close above this level on significant volume could signal a temporary respite from selling pressure. However, the real test lies at higher resistance levels, previously established around $2,500, where ETH struggled to maintain upward momentum.

Bitcoin ready to fight
Recent candlestick formations portray a scenario where Bitcoin is flirting with a critical resistance level, poised to either confirm a bearish trend or start a substantial recovery.
The chart illustrates Bitcoin’s recent descent, as it lost its foothold at the higher price echelons it previously occupied. However, amid this downward movement, Bitcoin is showing signs of resilience. The latest candles indicate a potential reversal as they hover around a significant support level, which can be identified at approximately $37,000, a region where buyers have historically stepped in.

A sustained hold above this point could catalyze renewed buying interest, which may drive the price toward the immediate resistance level at around $41,000. The significance of reclaiming this threshold cannot be understated, as it may invalidate the bearish outlook and signal a trend reversal.

As for the upper resistances, the $43,000 and $46,000 price levels stand out as notable barriers that Bitcoin would need to breach to cement a robust recovery narrative. Achieving such milestones could sway market sentiment positively, potentially ushering in a wave of optimism among investors.

The moving averages offer additional insight, suggesting a possible bullish crossover should the current momentum persist. This scenario would be further supported by a rise in trading volume, which typically accompanies decisive trend shifts.

Solana among leaders
Solana shows signs of a nascent comeback, presenting a bullish scenario amid a broader market recovery. However, investors tread cautiously, aware of the potential of a ""dead cat bounce"" since volume profiles signal restraint.
Analyzing the SOL/USDT chart, we notice that Solana has established a local support level around the $70 price mark. This is characterized by multiple touches of this level over the past few weeks, each time resisting further downward movement.

On the flip side, the local resistance can be identified near the $96 level, which previously acted as support during Solana's consistent upward trend.

The price movement is currently sandwiched between the 50-day moving average acting as dynamic resistance and the 200-day moving average serving as potential dynamic support. The narrowing gap between these averages could squeeze the price action, possibly leading to a volatility breakout.

"XRP Starts Moving Earlier, Solana (SOL) Already Stronger Than Everyone Else; Does Ethereum (ETH) Need More Fuel?","U.Today - XRP appears to have begun its market movements earlier than anticipated. The chart shows a notable shift from the recent sideways trading pattern, as XRP starts to carve out a new direction.

As of the latest trends, XRP has been testing the support level around $0.50, a crucial psychological threshold for the asset. A sustained move below this level could signal further bearish momentum, potentially leading the price to test the next significant support zone around $0.47.

XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewOn the flip side, if XRP manages to stabilize and bounce back from the current support, the initial resistance is likely to be encountered near the $0.54 mark, where the 50-day moving average currently lies. This moving average has historically acted as a dynamic resistance level, and a breakout above could propel XRP toward the $0.56 level, which aligns with the 100-day moving average.

Further complicating the chart is the downward trendline that has been in play since the local high established in November. This trendline has repeatedly acted as resistance, pushing the price downward each time it has been tested. For a true reversal to be confirmed, XRP would need to break above this trendline with significant volume to validate the move.

Solana is leading pack
Solana is manifesting its strength as the top performer among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Despite overall market volatility, SOL's price action has been signaling a stronger recovery compared to other assets.
At the time of analysis, Solana is trading around the $90 mark, having rebounded with considerable momentum from the support level near $78.35. This pivotal point, bolstered by the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), has served as a springboard for the recent bullish trend. The price of SOL has been consistently creating higher lows, indicative of strong buying interest at these levels.

Resistance for SOL is currently looming at the $100 psychological level, a breakthrough of which could propel the price toward the next significant resistance at $110.

The relative strength of Solana is further substantiated by the resurgence of a risk appetite on the market, particularly evidenced by the blossoming of meme coins. This renewed interest in higher-risk assets typically bodes well for ecosystems like Solana that support a variety of decentralized applications and niche crypto projects.

Ethereum needs push
The Ethereum market is currently facing a confluence of challenges as it searches for the momentum to sustain its position. A recent chart analysis reveals an indecisive atmosphere among investors, with Ethereum struggling to find a strong directional move.
At present, Ethereum is hovering around the $2,200 mark, a level that has seen significant activity and is currently acting as a temporary support. However, the lack of bullish conviction suggests that this support level may not hold if a new wave of selling pressure emerges.

Resistance levels are observed near the $2,400 range, where previous attempts to break higher have been met with a firm rejection, indicating a substantial barrier to upward movement.

The selling pressure is partly attributed to the recent news of Celsius Network liquidating approximately $1 billion worth of Ethereum holdings. This substantial amount has the potential to saturate the market, overwhelming current liquidity and triggering a downturn. As a result, the $2,000 psychological level is eyed as the next critical support zone, a breach of which could see a sharp decline toward the $1,950 region, where the 200-day moving average lies, providing stronger historical support.

On the flip side, if Ethereum can absorb the selling pressure and gain the necessary ""fuel,"" a push above the $2,400 resistance could open the path toward the $2,500 area before challenging the more formidable resistance at $2,600, which aligns with the 50-day moving average.

"Dogecoin (DOGE) Breakout Occurs, What's Next? Solana (SOL) Stays Dominant, Will Ethereum (ETH) Survive Unseen Stalemate?","U.Today - Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency that started as a joke but became a favorite of the masses, including Elon Musk, has recently experienced a significant breakout.

After a period of consolidation, DOGE has broken past a critical resistance level, stirring excitement among traders and investors. The coin is currently sitting above the $0.088 mark, which previously acted as substantial resistance. If DOGE manages to maintain its position above this level, it could solidify this area as new support.

Dogecoin/USDT Chart by TradingViewA break above the $0.095 resistance could signal a continued bullish trend, potentially leading Dogecoin to test the psychological barrier of $0.10. If the momentum is sustained and market sentiment remains positive, DOGE could attempt to reach higher highs, possibly moving toward the $0.105 to $0.11 range last seen during its peak periods of trading activity.

Immediate support for DOGE is now at $0.088 which, if held, could act as a springboard for further climbs. However, should Dogecoin fail to maintain this level, it might fall back to its previous support near $0.078, where buyers have historically shown interest.

A scenario where DOGE's breakout continues would likely involve increased adoption news or a resurgence of interest in meme coins, potentially sparked by social media or celebrity endorsements. Such catalysts could drive demand and push DOGE past the $0.095 level, cementing its breakout status.

Conversely, if the breakout fails to sustain, perhaps due to broader market bearishness or fading interest, DOGE could slide back below $0.088. This would retest the resilience of the $0.078 support. A drop below this level could lead to a bearish phase, with DOGE potentially seeking lower ground.

Solana shows strength
During this market cycle, Solana has established itself as a leader. With its stable and easily scalable performance, it outpaces giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as the majority of DeFi volume went to the ""Ethereum killer.""
As the DeFi ecosystem on Solana flourishes, it is becoming a hub for innovation, blending meme culture with decentralized applications. The network's efficiency and scalability are attracting a wide array of developers.

The cryptocurrency that has been on a strong upward trajectory. Currently, Solana is testing a resistance level at approximately $100, a significant psychological and technical barrier. A convincing break above this level could signal continued bullish momentum, potentially leading to testing the next resistance zone around $108, which coincides with recent highs.

On the downside, the 50-day moving average, sitting near $93.23, is providing dynamic support. This level has been defended multiple times, indicating its importance to traders. If Solana can maintain its footing above this moving average, it would reinforce the asset's stability and could serve as a springboard for further gains.

The next crucial test for Solana will be sustaining above $100. Should it consolidate above this level, it would not be unrealistic to envision a push toward $108, or even higher, as the market reassesses Solana's value proposition in the context of a rapidly evolving DeFi and NFT landscape.

Fundamental Ethereum problems
As it struggles to gain momentum, Ethereum's scalability suffering and the diminishing traction of meme coins on its network are at the forefront of the bearish case for the second-biggest cryptocurrency on the market.
The network's inability to handle high transaction volumes without exorbitant fees has led to the sentiment that Ethereum is becoming ""unusable"" for the day-to-day transactions that meme coins require.

From a technical standpoint, Ethereum's price analysis paints a picture of uncertainty. The asset has been struggling to maintain momentum above crucial support levels. Currently, Ethereum is wavering around the $2,250 mark, with immediate support near the $2,150 level. A break below this support could see a decline toward the $2,000 psychological barrier, which would represent a significant bearish development.

Layer-2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum have emerged as potential stopgaps, offering faster and cheaper transactions. However, their adoption has been less than stellar, with many viewing these platforms as temporary fixes rather than a comprehensive solution to Ethereum's underlying scalability problems.

"Arbitrum (ARB) Rally Halted, Ethereum (ETH) Makes Important Reminder, Did Solana (SOL) Hit Ceiling?","U.Today - The leading layer-2 solution in the Ethereum ecosystem, Arbitrum, has recently seen a significant rally, but this has been interrupted, indicating a potential reversal in its price trajectory.

ARB's price movement had been bullish, as evidenced by its ascent past the moving averages, which served as dynamic support levels during its uptrend. However, the price has encountered substantial resistance, leading to a halt in its rally.

ARB/USDT Chart by TradingViewThe chart demonstrates ARB's struggle to maintain its upward momentum, with the token facing a critical resistance level at approximately $2.00. After failing to breach this threshold, ARB experienced a pullback, currently trading around $1.80.

The support levels to watch are strategically positioned at $1.68 and $1.47, which could provide a safety net for the price if the downward pressure persists. It may also find a stronger base at $1.32, a level that could be fundamental for buyers to reenter the market. Conversely, a bounce off the support could signal a potential for growth, with a retest of the $2.00 resistance level and possible breakout.

Ethereum shows some aggression
As the cryptocurrency market continues its dynamic ebb and flow, Ethereum (ETH) provides a salient reminder of its resilience and potential for growth. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has recently seen a reversal in its price, suggesting a potential shift in market sentiment and positioning.
The price analysis of Ethereum shows a significant level of activity around the $2,400 price point, suggesting this is a key resistance level. After a period of upward movement, ETH's price action indicates a halt and potential retracement from this level. This movement could be indicative of the market catching its breath after a period of accumulation.

Despite ETH's uptick in movement, it has not mirrored the performance of some of its contemporaries like Solana, or even Bitcoin. While these cryptocurrencies have seen more robust growth, Ethereum's progression appears more measured, possibly due to its already substantial market penetration and the maturation of its ecosystem.

The support levels for Ethereum stand firmly at around $2,197 and $2,033, which are crucial if Ethereum were to sustain a further drop in price. These levels may act as a springboard for price recovery should market conditions remain favorable. Conversely, the resistance level at approximately $2,400 is proving to be a formidable barrier to overcome.

The current technical outlook suggests Ethereum may indeed rally to test the $2,400 resistance level again. However, investors should be prepared for a possible retracement following this test. The interplay of support and resistance levels will be crucial in determining ETH's price trajectory in the short term.

Solana's rally on pause?
Solana has recently hit a metaphorical ceiling, as the fervor around the DeFi industry and meme coins that once propelled its value upward has begun to decline. This cooling on the NFT market has contributed to the deceleration in SOL's price momentum, as evidenced by the latest price charts.
A close analysis of the SOL price chart indicates a reversal from its upward trajectory, with the asset facing resistance at approximately $101. The resistance level has proven to be a formidable barrier, with Solana struggling to maintain the bullish momentum it had gained in the past.

Support levels for Solana are observed around the $94 and $76 marks. These levels may offer some respite to the asset’s price if the downward pressure continues. If Solana dips to these support levels and holds, it could signal the potential for recovery and another attempt to break through the current resistance.

Despite the recent slowdown, Solana has indeed had an impressive run. Its ecosystem continues to develop, and while the immediate future may not look as bright as it once did, the possibility of a rebound remains. The market’s cyclical nature and the potential for innovation within Solana’s platform could provide the necessary catalyst for another period of growth.

Ethereum (ETH) Staking Ratio Surprisingly Keeps Surging Despite Shapella,"U.Today - Ki Young Ju, founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, leading on-chain analytical firm, shared his views on the Ethereum (ETH) staking progress. He admits he was wrong about Shapella hard fork's effects.

Ethereum (ETH) staking ratio surges to 24% and counting
Ethereum (ETH) staking ratio, i.e., the percentage of ETH coins locked in staking, reaches 24% and keeps surging. Meanwhile, only 11% of the ETH supply is stored on centralized exchanges. The data was shared by Ki Young Ju on X today, on Jan. 18, 2024.
As such, it is safe to say that the overhyped Ethereum (ETH) upgrade Shapella that allowed stakers to withdraw their coins for the first time since December 2020 did not result in massive unstaking:

Ethereum's (ETH) Shapella was activated in April 2023. As crypto markets were still dominated by bearish sentiment, analysts were expecting withdrawals and consecutive sell-offs of Ethereum (ETH).

The Ethereum (ETH) price also managed to go through this event without significant losses: as stakers withdrew 1 million Ethers (ETH) in first week post-Shapella, the ETH price was fluctuating between $2,000 and $2,100.

Staked Ethereums (ETH) are mostly profitable, Mr. Ki Young Ju adds. While the realized price for staking inflows is $2,014, the current ETH rate is $2,519. As such, the average Ether ""stake"" is being held with a significant 25% profit.

The aggregated volume of the Ethereum (ETH) staking ecosystem is estimated at a whopping $72 billion, with 4.25% in APY, Staking Rewards data says.

Сardano (ADA) staking close to surpassing Solana (SOL)
At the same time, the largest Ethereum (ETH) competitors might be close to a historic ""flippening."" The Solana (SOL) staking ratio is plummeting. The indicator lost over 20% in the last week and dipped below 67%.
Meanwhile, the Cardano (ADA) staking ecosystem added 0.06% in the last seven days and is getting closer to 64%. At the same time, the USD-denominated volume of Solana (SOL) staking is over 200% larger than that of Cardano (ADA).

Out of all mainstream altcoins, Mina Protocol (MINA) demonstrates the largest staking ratio: its stakers locked over 91% of the circulating supply.

Aptos (APT) and Sui (SUI) follow the Mina Protocol (MINA) with 85%-86% in staking ratio.

He admits he was wrong about Shapella hard fork's effects.

Ethereum (ETH) staking ratio surges to 24% and counting
Ethereum (ETH) staking ratio, i.e., the percentage of ETH coins locked in staking, reaches 24% and keeps surging. Meanwhile, only 11% of the ETH supply is stored on centralized exchanges. The data was shared by Ki Young Ju on X today, on Jan. 18, 2024.
As such, it is safe to say that the overhyped Ethereum (ETH) upgrade Shapella that allowed stakers to withdraw their coins for the first time since December 2020 did not result in massive unstaking:

Ethereum's (ETH) Shapella was activated in April 2023. As crypto markets were still dominated by bearish sentiment, analysts were expecting withdrawals and consecutive sell-offs of Ethereum (ETH).

The Ethereum (ETH) price also managed to go through this event without significant losses: as stakers withdrew 1 million Ethers (ETH) in first week post-Shapella, the ETH price was fluctuating between $2,000 and $2,100.

Staked Ethereums (ETH) are mostly profitable, Mr. Ki Young Ju adds. While the realized price for staking inflows is $2,014, the current ETH rate is $2,519. As such, the average Ether ""stake"" is being held with a significant 25% profit.

The aggregated volume of the Ethereum (ETH) staking ecosystem is estimated at a whopping $72 billion, with 4.25% in APY, Staking Rewards data says.

"Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin Makes Surprising Visit to Binance, SHIB Rep Shares Shibarium's Plans to Onboard Thousands of Projects: Crypto News Digest by U.Today","U.Today - Take a look at the most important crypto events with U.Today's top three news stories.

Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin makes surprising visit to Binance
As has been recently shared by Binance CEO Richard Teng on the X platform, Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin made a surprising visit to the Binance office. Teng thanked Buterin for finding time to speak to his team in person, saying that it was a privilege to have him in the company's office. This spontaneous visit caused quite a stir in the crypto community, with many users speculating about a potential collaboration between these two giants of the crypto market. As a reminder, Binance is currently struggling with a $4 billion fine and ongoing regulatory challenges; considering this, Buterin's focus (described in his essay entitled ""Make Ethereum Cypherpunk Again"") on security, privacy and scalability, and concern for centralized exchanges and their vulnerability to hacking, feed rumors about possible cooperation between Buterin and Binance. However, neither Buterin nor Teng made any statements in this regard.
Shibarium: Thousands of projects to join L2 network with numerous partnerships – SHIB rep
In a recent X post, Shiba Inu team member Lucie shared Shibarium's plans for the future. Lucie wrote that the layer-2 solution aims to ""onboard 1,000 projects with numerous partnerships,"" reminding the community that supporting new projects does not necessarily mean canceling existing ones. The SHIB representative then called on all meme token supporters to stay strong as a community during challenging times, stating that there is hardly any point in giving up now if they got ""this far"" in their support for the project's team. Lucie's post has evoked mixed reactions among SHIB army members; even though many of them praised the SHIB developers, some users questioned the project team's ability to accomplish anything more than just making plans and promising new advances.
JPMorgan: Bitcoin ETF hype cooling
According to Kenneth Worthington, analyst at JPMorgan, the initial enthusiasm surrounding Bitcoin ETFs may be waning, with a shift toward a ""more normalized flow environment"" being potentially on the horizon. On Jan. 26, spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced net sales of about $15 million following a four-day streak of redemptions. This reversal could be an indication of changing investor sentiment on these novel financial products. Since their launch, the Bitcoin price has plunged by about 9% but has since stabilized around $42,000 as the new trading week gets underway. Previously, JPMorgan correctly predicted that the approval of Bitcoin ETFs would be a sell-the-news event. Before the approval, the price of the leading cryptocurrency dropped from above $47,000 to below $39,000. The sell-off coincided with large outflows from Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which transitioned into a spot Bitcoin ETF after the SEC's approval.

"Ethereum (ETH) Jumps 11.4%, Here's How Whales Are Changing Game","U.Today - There is ongoing mega accumulation of Ethereum (ETH) by whales within the crypto ecosystem. According to data from the crypto analytics platform Lookonchain, a whale with the wallet address ""0xAA15"" withdrew a total of 5,762 ETH worth approximately $15.06 million from Binance earlier today. Overall, this whale has bought a total of 50,733 ETH $99.2 million at an average price of $1,955 since Sept. 19, 2023.

Per the Lookonchain outlook, another whale, ""0x9314"" also spent 7.29 million USDT to buy 2,800 ETH today, joining the host of accumulations of the second-largest cryptocurrency about two hours ago. This particular whale has a more robust portfolio, having stacked up a total of 82,780 ETH worth approximately $150.3 million at an average price of $1,816 since Jan 1, 2023.

The intriguing switch to Ethereum by these whales complements the $8.2 billion in large transaction volumes according to data from IntoTheBlock. These large transactions, which involve ETH worth at least $100,000, have jumped by 65.99% in the past 24 hours.

Ethereum’s whales are notably helping to change the game as the digital currency strives to recoup its lost ground to price action.

At the time of writing, Ethereum has jumped by 11.42% in the past 24 hours to $2,645.07. The cryptocurrency has grown from a 24-hour low of $2,353.93 to its price at the moment, driven in part by the hype ravaging the market following the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
This approval is boosting sentiment that the spot Ethereum ETF might also be on the way. This has further pushed retail sentiment as well, with Ethereum now notably eyeing the $2,700 benchmark.

"Here's Who Burned 9,001 ETH in Last 30 Days","U.Today - Uniswap, the world’s largest decentralized exchange, is apparently a top burner of Ethereum, with a staggering 9,001 ETH incinerated from the circulating supply in the last 30 days. This activity firmly positions Uniswap as a key player in the Ethereum ecosystem, not just in terms of volume but also in influencing the coin's scarcity.

The mechanism behind Ethereum's burn is a recent upgrade known as EIP-1559, which introduced a transaction fee burn for every operation made on the network. Uniswap, as the leading DEX, handles a massive volume of transactions, naturally leading to a higher rate of ETH being burned. This burn acts as a deflationary force on the supply of Ethereum, theoretically creating scarcity that could bolster the asset's value over the long term.

ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewHowever, the correlation between burn rate and immediate price action is not linear. While Uniswap's significant contribution to the burn rate underscores its dominance, the short-term impact on Ethereum’s price is subdued. Over a longer horizon, this deflationary mechanism is expected to establish a supportive base for the price of ETH, as reducing supply, ceteris paribus, should increase the value of each remaining ETH.

It is important to note, though, that scarcity alone does not guarantee value growth. The intrinsic value of Ethereum also hinges on its utility, adoption and broader market sentiment. Currently, Ethereum is facing stiff competition from Solana in ecosystem growth, with many traders who favor volatility and risk gravitating toward Solana.

A technical analysis of Ethereum's current price action shows a challenging market phase. Ethereum is attempting to hold support around the $2,400 level. Should it fail to sustain this, the next key support is observed at the $2,300 mark, near the 50-day EMA. A breach below this could see Ethereum test the $2,000 psychological support level. Conversely, if Ethereum can rally past the immediate resistance at $2,500, it could pave the way to retest previous highs near $2,800.

Vitalik Buterin Answers Major Bitcoin and Ethereum Question in Birthday Essay,"U.Today - Renowned Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin celebrated his 30 birthday today by releasing a thoughtful essay titled ""The End of My Childhood."" The essay delves into the genesis of cryptocurrencies, and Bitcoin in particular, underscoring its initial purpose as a response to the vulnerabilities of traditional banking systems.

In his reflective piece, Buterin questions the evolution of public discourse within the crypto space over the past 15 years, pondering whether the original narrative emphasizing financial disruption has waned. To address this, he proposes two pragmatic approaches for the crypto ecosystem.

First, Buterin advocates for a renewed emphasis on the significance of money and finance, urging the crypto space to actively contribute to serving underserved populations and fostering financial inclusion. Second, he envisions a broader role for crypto that extends beyond finance.

Highlighting the unique decentralized nature of the crypto industry, Buterin notes that developers are dispersed globally, and many major crypto projects are not bound by geographical constraints. He emphasizes the potential of non-Western developers to understand and address the concrete needs of users in low-income countries.

Ideal reality by Vitalik Buterin
Buterin's vision for Ethereum goes beyond financial applications. He envisions ETH as the foundation for a decentralized tech stack, emphasizing trustworthiness, democracy and privacy. Zero-knowledge proofs are identified as a key innovation in achieving these goals, offering a nuanced approach to issues of authenticity, manipulation and privacy.

Bitcoin and Ethereum Bulls Taking Control: $60 Million of Shorts Liquidated Ahead of Weekend,"U.Today - The cryptocurrency market is witnessing a strong bullish momentum as Bitcoin and Ethereum bulls start to assert control. In a significant development, shorts worth approximately $60 million have been liquidated, signaling a potential shift in market sentiment as we approach the weekend.

Analyzing the current charts, Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience, managing to sustain above the crucial support level of $40,000. The coin has recently experienced a rebound from this level, which has historically acted as a strong psychological barrier for both bulls and bears.

Source: CoinglassIf BTC maintains its position above this support, the next key resistance to watch will be around $42,000, a level where we might expect some consolidation before a further push. On the downside, if the $40,000 level fails to hold, traders should look for potential support near the $38,500 region.

Ethereum, on the other hand, is also showing signs of recovery after a recent sell-off. The coin has found support near the $2,100 mark, just above the 200-day exponential moving average, which is often considered a significant indicator of long-term trends.

If ETH can sustain this rebound, the immediate resistance is expected at $2,400. A breakthrough above this could open the path toward $2,500, a level that previously acted as both support and resistance. A fall below the current support level could see the price testing the next support zone around $2,000.

The liquidation heatmap provides additional context, illustrating the pressure on short sellers as the market moves against their positions. This liquidation is particularly evident in the case of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have seen a significant number of short positions being closed in a short span of time. Overall, the market is currently displaying bullish signs, with strong support levels holding up.

Ethereum (ETH) Needs These 3 Crucial Factors to Align for Growth: Details,"U.Today - Despite Ethereum's position as a frontrunner in the altcoin sector, its growth has been stunted by a bearish trend that has held a tight grip on the market in recent weeks. A closer look at the ETH chart reveals that the expected volatility spike that could catalyze a bullish reversal has yet to materialize.

Layer-2 network adoption and ecosystem expansion
First, the surge of layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism could be a catalyst for Ethereum's growth. These networks aim to enhance Ethereum's ecosystem by providing the much-needed scalability and reduced fees, potentially driving renewed interest and increased adoption of the Ethereum network.
ETH/USD Chart by TradingView

Scalability and network efficiency
Second, Ethereum's persistent scalability issues must be addressed. Despite the implementation of EIP-1559, which was anticipated to make transaction fees more predictable, the network still struggles under high demand, leading to exorbitant fees and reduced network functionality. Resolving these scalability woes is crucial, as a more efficient and cost-effective network is vital for Ethereum to retain its value and utility.
Introduction of Ethereum ETF
Finally, the establishment of an Ethereum ETF would be a strong bullish signal, mirroring the impact of the Bitcoin ETF. An Ethereum ETF would pave the way for institutional investment, providing a regulated and accessible means for traditional investors to gain exposure to ETH. This could secure Ethereum's future as a mainstream financial asset and provide a stable foundation for long-term growth.
Looking at the Ethereum chart, we identify a local resistance level at approximately $2433.5, a price point that has acted as a hurdle in recent trading sessions. For a bullish case to solidify, Ethereum needs to break past this resistance with conviction. Should this occur, it could signal a shift in investor sentiment and open the path to higher price levels.

Scalability and network efficiency
Second, Ethereum's persistent scalability issues must be addressed. Despite the implementation of EIP-1559, which was anticipated to make transaction fees more predictable, the network still struggles under high demand, leading to exorbitant fees and reduced network functionality. Resolving these scalability woes is crucial, as a more efficient and cost-effective network is vital for Ethereum to retain its value and utility.
Introduction of Ethereum ETF
Finally, the establishment of an Ethereum ETF would be a strong bullish signal, mirroring the impact of the Bitcoin ETF. An Ethereum ETF would pave the way for institutional investment, providing a regulated and accessible means for traditional investors to gain exposure to ETH. This could secure Ethereum's future as a mainstream financial asset and provide a stable foundation for long-term growth.
Looking at the Ethereum chart, we identify a local resistance level at approximately $2433.5, a price point that has acted as a hurdle in recent trading sessions. For a bullish case to solidify, Ethereum needs to break past this resistance with conviction. Should this occur, it could signal a shift in investor sentiment and open the path to higher price levels.

Self-Proclaimed Satoshi Craig Wright Takes Dig at Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin,"U.Today - In an unexpected turn of events today, self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto Craig Wright took a swipe at Ethereum's creator, Vitalik Buterin. Wright revisited a series of posts by Buterin in 2017, where he discussed the early versions of the Ethereum protocol.

Back then, Buterin had responded to a question about the possibility of building Ethereum on top of Bitcoin, expressing concerns about potential conflicts with Bitcoin's development team. He cited fears that protocol rules might change, making it difficult for him to build on a base protocol at odds with his vision.

Fast forward to January 2024, and Wright seized the opportunity to comment on Buterin's past remarks. He argued that Ethereum only exists due to centralized development teams that have the power to alter the protocol. Wright mused about the hypothetical scenario of having everything built on Bitcoin, envisioning a more streamlined and less fragmented system.

Bitcoin v. Ethereum
Wright's comments add fuel to the longstanding rivalry between Bitcoin and Ethereum, highlighting fundamental differences in their approaches to decentralization and protocol governance.
While Ethereum has achieved considerable success as a platform for smart contracts and applications, Wright argues for the stability and originality of Bitcoin's protocol.

Moreover, it revives the centralization debate in both cryptocurrency ecosystems. On the one side is OFAC's censorship of ETH transactions; on the other side is the enormous concentration of BTC in the hands of whales and miners.

"Samson Mow Takes Subtle Jab at Ethereum (ETH), Is XRP Next?","U.Today - Samson Mow, the chief executive officer of investment firm Jan3 and prominent Bitcoin (BTC) bull and evangelist, has taken his advocacy for the top coin to a new level. In his latest post on X, he took a subtle jab at alternative investment assets, including Silver and Ethereum (ETH), as his way of reducing their viability in comparison to their counterparts Gold and Silver.

Samson Mow analogy
According to Samson Mow, Silver is the poor man’s Gold, a statement that shows that investors who consider the latter to be too expensive typically opt in for the former. While both are respected metals and investment assets, Gold is still considered the superior of the two.
Samson Mow deflated Ethereum’s ego to end the long-standing superiority debate with Bitcoin. The vocal investor noted that ""Ethereum is the stupid man's Bitcoin,"" a statement that spooked members of the ETH community.

By valuation, Bitcoin’s market cap currently stands at $809,923,408,001, while that of Ethereum comes in at $297,575,053,741. The price differentials of $41,344.01 to $2,476.66 also show that Bitcoin is the most valuable of the two. Over time, there have been conversations about shifting capital from BTC to ETH, a trend that might be amplified in the coming months if Ethereum’s key fundamentals come into play.

The harsh criticism of Ethereum did not go down well with its community members, with some pointing out the key improvements the protocol has made as a blockchain in itself.

Is XRP next?
As a Bitcoin Maxi, Samson Mow was asked by one of the commenters on his post what he thinks about XRP if Ethereum is the poor man’s Bitcoin. He simply answered that the demand is a ""tricky one.""
Samson Mow’s confidence in Bitcoin has made him forecast a $1 million price target, and his lack of confidence in XRP and Ethereum has undoubtedly made his bearish stand subtle.

Ethereum (ETH) Faces Serious Bug; Here's Who Might Be Affected,"U.Today - Ethereum is potentially facing a significant bug that has emerged, previously only assumed as a hypothetical scenario in discussions among the developer and validator community back in March 2022, but now it looms as a potential threat that could become a reality.

This bug concerns the Ethereum staking mechanism and how the network reaches consensus. In essence, if a majority client, holding more than 2/3 of the stake, has a bug, it could inadvertently build an invalid chain that the network would consider finalized due to the majority stake's ""agreement.""

If validators running this buggy client commit to this incorrect chain, any attempt to switch to a correct chain could result in severe penalties due to how the Ethereum protocol is designed to penalize what it sees as ""equivocating"" validators.

What makes this situation particularly alarming is the scale of the potential impact. If this bug manifests, the validators could find themselves in a predicament where they either continue to support an incorrect chain or switch to a correct one at great personal cost. The validators running the buggy client would face a dilemma: lose their stake through penalties or persist with an invalid chain, endangering the network's integrity.

For the average Ethereum holder not involved in staking or blockchain development, this might seem distant, but the implications can be far-reaching. An individual commented that the situation is ""pretty scary,"" and it is also the main reason why they do not stake any ETH. This sentiment reflects a potentially surging concern among holders who fear the ripple effects a bug of this magnitude could have on the network's trust and stability.

Centralized exchanges (CEXes), although well capitalized, might also feel the effect of potential finalization issues. Though their liquidity is far more resilient, mitigating large losses might still become an issue.

"Ethereum Whale Moves $46 Million in ETH Across Binance, Bitfinex and Aave: Details","U.Today - In a surprising move that has captured the attention of the cryptocurrency community, an Ethereum (ETH) whale has orchestrated a series of transactions involving major exchanges, moving a staggering $46.02 million in ETH over the past two days. The entity, utilizing a network of eight wallets, withdrew funds from Binance and Bitfinex before staking with Lido, a liquid staking solution.

Blockchain analytics platform Spot On Chain first brought attention to the substantial transactions through a tweet, revealing intricate details of the massive ETH movement. The whale withdrew the Ethereum holdings from crypto exchanges Binance and Bitfinex at an average price of approximately $2,419.

Subsequently, five wallets were employed to withdraw 50.15 million USDT from Aave, a prominent DeFi protocol, to the CEX trading platform, exchanging the stablecoin for 19,021 ETH, equivalent to the $46.02 million value. Spot On Chain further disclosed that three wallets still retained around 30 million USDT in Aave, sparking speculation that they might deposit these funds into a CEX soon, potentially acquiring more ETH.

Ethereum price struggles
The timing of these transactions coincided with a challenging period for the Ethereum market. At the time of the whale's activity, the price of ETH struggled, recording a 4.57% dip in the last 24 hours and a 9.46% decline in the past week. Current market data indicates ETH trading at $2,296.
Coinglass, another analytics platform, reported a significant amount of liquidations for ETH within the last 24 hours, totaling $53.78 million. Of this amount, $47.48 million resulted from long liquidations, while short liquidations accounted for $6.29 million. The liquidation data underscores the volatility and uncertainty prevalent on the market, with traders experiencing significant losses.

Market analysts and enthusiasts are closely monitoring these developments, as such large-scale transactions from influential entities often lead to speculation and conjecture regarding potential market impacts. Traders and investors are advised to exercise caution and stay vigilant as the cryptocurrency landscape continues to unfold, revealing the dynamics of this rapidly evolving market.

Ethereum (ETH) Becomes Target of Massive $1 Billion Sell-Off: Who's Responsible?,"U.Today - Ethereum is encountering a massive sell-off exceeding $1 billion. The source of this enormous market movement can be traced back to Celsius, which reportedly transferred a staggering 459,561 ETH, valued at approximately $1.014 billion, to various exchanges.

The distribution of this sell-off was as follows: 297,454 ETH ($656.5 million) moved to Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) Prime, 146,507 ETH to Paxos Treasury and smaller amounts of 7,800 ETH each, totaling $17.2 million, were transferred to FalconX and Coinbase. Despite this massive transfer, Celsius reportedly retains a reserve of 62,468 ETH, worth around $139 million.

Such a colossal sale exerts immense pressure on Ethereum's price and could significantly sway market sentiment. The immediate concern for investors and traders is whether Ethereum's liquidity and market capitalization can absorb such a hit without triggering a broad market downturn.

From a technical analysis standpoint, the massive outflow from Celsius is a bearish signal, likely to test Ethereum's local support levels. A crucial support to watch is around the $2,000 price range, a psychological and technical support level, which, if breached, could see the price tumble to the next significant support at $1,800. This level has historically acted as a strong buy zone and may serve as a robust defense against further declines.

Conversely, resistance levels have become more formidable due to the sell-off. Any potential recovery will have to confront the resistance at $2,200, which previously acted as a support level. A break above this could see Ethereum attempt to reclaim higher price levels, possibly testing the $2,400 resistance.

The substantial sell-off initiated by Celsius has placed Ethereum in a problematic position. Although the Ethereum network's fundamentals remain robust, the asset's price resilience in the face of such a significant sell-off shows the actual state of the market.

Ethereum Closer to Epic Rebranding as Sepolia Welcomes Dencun Upgrade,"U.Today - The Ethereum blockchain is on its way to a massive rebranding as its long-awaited Dencun upgrade is now live on the Sepolia testnet. The Ethereum Foundation projected that the Dencun upgrade would launch on Sepolia by Jan. 30, and the successful integration was revealed by core developer Terrence.eth, for which he received many accolades from the community.

The Dencun upgrade going live on Sepolia is one of the two remaining steps required to launch the update on the Ethereum mainnet. Ethereum has long been plagued with lower scalability and high gas fees. For this, it has continued to receive intense backlash from industry analysts like legendary trader Peter Brandt, who considers its high cost of operation a basis for its demise in the long term.

The Dencun upgrade will attempt to resolve scalability issues while also making Ethereum more cost-effective as a protocol. The Dencun upgrade will specifically introduce proto-danksharding, a compressed data storage mechanism dubbed ""blobs"" to help optimize performance.

Development efforts are now in their advanced stages as the upgrade was launched on the Goerli testnet earlier this month. The last step before the mainnet debut will be to launch on the Holesky testnet, an upgrade that is scheduled for Feb. 7.

Ethereum to fight back against its competitors
Many new protocols have emerged to capitalize on the weakness of the Ethereum protocol. From Solana (SOL) to Cardano (ADA) and even Avalanche (AVAX), the race to dethrone Ethereum remains the core mantra for many developers in the Web3 ecosystem today.
With the Dencun upgrade, many of the pain points on Ethereum can be resolved, thus making the protocol more attractive to developers and end users overall. With the upgrade, Ethereum is poised to extend its dominance as the top blockchain of choice for all things decentralized finance (DeFi) and more.

Major FED Decision to Affect Crypto Market in Two Days,"U.Today - The crypto market is bracing itself as the Federal Reserve gears up to announce its first interest rate decision of 2024. The whispers from the CME about a 96.9% chance to keep interest rates unchanged are causing ripples. Yet, with the second decision in March casting a 47% shadow of a rate cut by 25 basis points (bps), investors are on edge. Adding to the economic fervor, the United States is set to release the January unemployment rate, which could further sway market sentiment.

The Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates is a critical economic lever that traditionally influences traditional markets and, as has been seen, the cryptocurrency market as well. An unchanged interest rate could maintain the status quo, possibly keeping investment steady in assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

A cut, however, could signal economic caution, potentially reducing the attractiveness of risk assets like cryptocurrencies or, conversely, could lead investors to seek higher returns in the crypto market if traditional investments falter.

BTC/USD Chart by TradingViewAnalyzing the Bitcoin chart, there is a distinctive ""war"" between the bulls and bears. The immediate resistance level to watch is around the $42,500 mark, which Bitcoin has been testing recently. This level is crucial because a decisive close above it could signal increasing bullish momentum. On the downside, the support level at approximately $39,528, aligning with a psychological round number and a previous area of interest, is one that traders are likely to defend vigorously.

The upcoming Fed decision could serve as a catalyst for Bitcoin's next big move. If interest rates remain unchanged, Bitcoin could continue to test the resistance level, and a break above could confirm a bullish reversal. However, should rates decrease, Bitcoin's reaction might be even more unpredictable.

"Shiba Inu (SHIB) Rapidly Breaks Down, Ethereum (ETH) Loses Traction, While Solana (SOL) Presents Hidden Opportunity","U.Today - Shiba Inu has experienced a significant breakdown from its recent consolidation phase. The chart depicts a clear downward trajectory as SHIB failed to maintain its position within the ascending triangle pattern it had formed over the past few months.

The breakdown was signaled as SHIB prices breached the key support level at $0.000009, which had previously acted as a reliable floor for the price during consolidation phases. Following this, SHIB prices tumbled further, slicing through subsequent support near $0.0000087. This price action marked a decisive shift in market sentiment from accumulation to distribution.

SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewThe next support level to watch is at $0.0000082, where SHIB may find a temporary reprieve from the selling pressure. If this level fails to hold, the next critical support lies at $0.0000076, which could serve as the last line of defense before a more significant drop.

For a reversal to occur and for SHIB to regain its upward momentum, it would need to reclaim previous support levels and transform them back into supports. This would require a substantial influx of buying pressure, potentially sparked by positive developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem or broader cryptocurrency market rallies.

The first sign of a possible reversal would be a return above $0.0000087, followed by a sustained move above the $0.000009 price level. A breakout above these levels, accompanied by increasing volume, could indicate that the downtrend is losing steam and that bulls are regaining control.

Solana paints reversal pattern
Solana has been developing a subtle yet potentially pivotal chart pattern. The asset has been tracing a slow and steady ascending channel, a formation that suggests a controlled and consistent uptrend. This pattern, characterized by higher lows and higher highs contained within two parallel trendlines, speaks to potential for continued growth.
The significance of this pattern lies in the momentum it could provide for SOL. Should the price action remain strong within the upper half of the channel, and particularly if it challenges the upper trendline, we could see Solana break through and embark on a more aggressive rally.

Such a bullish scenario would likely be supported by increased trading volume and positive developments within the Solana ecosystem, such as new project launches or updates that enhance network performance.

The immediate local resistance stands at around $55, and a confident push beyond this could confirm bullish sentiment. Inversely, if Solana's price dips below the channel's lower boundary, around $48, it could indicate that a bearish narrative is taking hold.

Ethereum momentum decreasing
Ethereum is exhibiting signs of waning momentum, as observed in recent price movements. The asset, which has long been considered the backbone of the decentralized finance sector, is facing a pivotal moment that could determine its trajectory for the coming weeks.
The provided chart illustrates Ethereum's struggle to maintain its grasp on the market. The price has been on a downward trend, edging closer to the local 26-day Exponential Moving Average. This level, currently near $2,465, is critical; if Ethereum fails to hold this line, we might see it descend to test the more significant 50 EMA, which stands around the $2,300 mark.

The 26 EMA serves as a short-term sentiment gauge, and its breach could signal a lack of immediate bullish support. Should this level fail to act as a springboard for price recovery, Ethereum's next stop could indeed be the 50 EMA. A breach below this longer-term moving average could potentially open the gates for a test of lower support levels, highlighting the need for investors to brace for more volatility.

Market participants are now recalibrating their expectations, understanding that the road to sustainable gains is a long-term journey.

The chart depicts a clear downward trajectory as SHIB failed to maintain its position within the ascending triangle pattern it had formed over the past few months.

The breakdown was signaled as SHIB prices breached the key support level at $0.000009, which had previously acted as a reliable floor for the price during consolidation phases. Following this, SHIB prices tumbled further, slicing through subsequent support near $0.0000087. This price action marked a decisive shift in market sentiment from accumulation to distribution.

SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewThe next support level to watch is at $0.0000082, where SHIB may find a temporary reprieve from the selling pressure. If this level fails to hold, the next critical support lies at $0.0000076, which could serve as the last line of defense before a more significant drop.

For a reversal to occur and for SHIB to regain its upward momentum, it would need to reclaim previous support levels and transform them back into supports. This would require a substantial influx of buying pressure, potentially sparked by positive developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem or broader cryptocurrency market rallies.

The first sign of a possible reversal would be a return above $0.0000087, followed by a sustained move above the $0.000009 price level. A breakout above these levels, accompanied by increasing volume, could indicate that the downtrend is losing steam and that bulls are regaining control.

Solana paints reversal pattern
Solana has been developing a subtle yet potentially pivotal chart pattern. The asset has been tracing a slow and steady ascending channel, a formation that suggests a controlled and consistent uptrend. This pattern, characterized by higher lows and higher highs contained within two parallel trendlines, speaks to potential for continued growth.
The significance of this pattern lies in the momentum it could provide for SOL. Should the price action remain strong within the upper half of the channel, and particularly if it challenges the upper trendline, we could see Solana break through and embark on a more aggressive rally.

Such a bullish scenario would likely be supported by increased trading volume and positive developments within the Solana ecosystem, such as new project launches or updates that enhance network performance.

The immediate local resistance stands at around $55, and a confident push beyond this could confirm bullish sentiment. Inversely, if Solana's price dips below the channel's lower boundary, around $48, it could indicate that a bearish narrative is taking hold.

Ethereum momentum decreasing
Ethereum is exhibiting signs of waning momentum, as observed in recent price movements. The asset, which has long been considered the backbone of the decentralized finance sector, is facing a pivotal moment that could determine its trajectory for the coming weeks.
The provided chart illustrates Ethereum's struggle to maintain its grasp on the market. The price has been on a downward trend, edging closer to the local 26-day Exponential Moving Average. This level, currently near $2,465, is critical; if Ethereum fails to hold this line, we might see it descend to test the more significant 50 EMA, which stands around the $2,300 mark.

The 26 EMA serves as a short-term sentiment gauge, and its breach could signal a lack of immediate bullish support. Should this level fail to act as a springboard for price recovery, Ethereum's next stop could indeed be the 50 EMA. A breach below this longer-term moving average could potentially open the gates for a test of lower support levels, highlighting the need for investors to brace for more volatility.

Market participants are now recalibrating their expectations, understanding that the road to sustainable gains is a long-term journey.

"XRP's Epic Battle Against Bears, Solana Breaks $100, While Ethereum Fights for Momentum","U.Today - XRP is currently locked in a fierce struggle with bearish forces. The digital asset, which operates within the Ripple network, is experiencing difficulty establishing a position above a critical technical indicator — the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).

The 200 EMA serves as an important barometer for the long-term trend and investor sentiment. For XRP, remaining below this level suggests that the asset lacks the bullish momentum needed to shift into an upward trajectory. This inability to secure a foothold above the 200 EMA raises questions about the stability of positive price action in the near term.

XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewTechnical analysis shows that the 200 EMA is a dynamic level of resistance that many traders watch closely. A consistent failure to breach this mark can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy where the resistance level grows stronger, as more traders set their sell orders around this key price point.

Ethereum keeps on struggling
Ethereum is showing signs of losing its upward momentum, failing to form a higher high — an indicator that market experts often interpret as a sign of an impending price correction.
The ETH chart reveals a telling pattern; the absence of a new higher high is significant. Typically, in a bullish market phase, the price of an asset creates a series of higher highs and higher lows. However, Ethereum's inability to push beyond its recent peak may suggest that the bulls are running out of steam and a reevaluation of market sentiment could be underway.

Analyzing the chart, the local resistance level has been a tough ceiling for Ethereum to break. This resistance, where sell orders tend to cluster, is acting as a barrier preventing further upward movement. On the flip side, the support level represents a price point with a concentration of buy orders, offering a potential cushion against a price drop. If Ethereum fails to uphold the support level, it could trigger a price breakdown, signaling a shift to a bearish trend.

If Ethereum's price continues to struggle, the scenario could unfold where the asset drops further, testing subsequent support levels. While the underlying fundamentals of Ethereum, such as network upgrades and adoption rates, remain robust, the short-term price action could still be subject to corrective forces.

Solana wants another round
The battleground of volatility on the crypto market continues, and Solana (SOL) has not been spared from its whims. Once a darling of the crypto world for its speed and efficiency, SOL has recently been up against a wall, struggling to surpass the crucial $100 mark. The price chart reflects a narrative of struggle and resistance, painting a picture of an asset in need of momentum.
The technical outlook for SOL is looking promising. After a period of bullish activity that piqued the interest of many investors, SOL has hit a snag near the $100 resistance level. This resistance level represents a significant psychological and financial barrier, as it is where sell orders tend to accumulate, putting downward pressure on the price.

Despite efforts to rally, the asset has been unable to generate the necessary momentum to overcome this threshold with ease and currently consolidates at it. One of the key factors influencing this lackluster performance could be the market's tepid reaction to the announcement of Solana phone Saga 2. The news, which might have been expected to inject some enthusiasm onto the market, failed to provide substantial support for Solana's price.

Looking at the chart, the local support levels are clearly delineated. The first line of defense for SOL lies around the $88-$90 price range, where previous dips have found buyers waiting. Should this level fail to hold, the next support may not emerge until it reaches the more robust $70 level, which could act as a stronger foothold for the price.

Conversely, resistance beyond $100 is now more formidable than ever. With each rejection, the resolve of buyers weakens, and the $100 level transforms from a mere price point into a crucial psychological level you should not miss.

"XRP Is Surprisingly Stable, Here's Why","U.Today - XRP is currently holding above the crucial 200-day EMA, a level that has morphed into a dynamic support line. This pivotal line, sitting approximately at $0.55, is now the battleground where XRP's short-term destiny is being contested.

In recent days, XRP's price action has been characterized by its struggle to overcome a series of local resistance levels. A notable rejection was faced around the $0.63 mark, which has added to the narrative of an asset under pressure. Despite these rejections, the asset's ability to stay afloat above the 200-day EMA suggests underlying strength and potential for growth.

XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewThe market's oppressiveness toward XRP can be attributed to various factors, including lack of usecase for XRP and a poor performance throughout the 2023. However, the past has shown that XRP can swiftly shift from oppressed states to strong bullish rallies, often catching many off-guard.

For a scenario where XRP's growth continues, it is essential for the token to maintain its stand above the 200-day EMA. If this level holds, it can serve as a springboard for future bullish attempts. A decisive close above this moving average could stimulate investor confidence, potentially leading to a challenge of the recent resistance at $0.63. A break and hold above this level could signal a trend reversal and may pave the way for XRP to target higher resistances, possibly around the $0.70 to $0.75 regions.

Solana is back in uptrend
Solana is showing signs of entering an uptrend once more. The recent price chart reveals a pattern of resilience, with Solana forming a higher low that indicates a potential shift in market sentiment.
After dipping to a support level around $88 on December 20, 2023, Solana has rebounded, forming a higher low near the $90 mark. This movement suggests accumulating strength and a possible change in direction from the previous downward trend. The local trendline resistance, which Solana is currently testing, is evident at approximately $97.50.

Two pivotal price levels stand out on Solana's chart. The first resistance level after the trendline sits near the $100 psychological mark. This round number has historically been a challenging point for Solana to breach decisively. Beyond that, the $104 level looms as the next significant barrier, which was a previous local high around January 3, 2024.

Conversely, on the support side, the level to watch is around $88, as mentioned earlier. This price has proven to be a firm foundation, with buyers stepping in to uphold Solana's valuation. A secondary support level is present near $85, just below the 50-day moving average, acting as a safety net for any potential retracements.

Ethereum's dominance prevails
Ethereum swiftly cuts through resistance levels with a bullish fervor that has not been seen in recent times. After a spirited 8.8% pump, Ethereum has confidently surpassed the $2,500 and $2,600 milestones, setting its sights firmly on the next major resistance level at $3,000.
The rapid growth witnessed in the past few days has been nothing short of impressive. Ethereum, which lingered around the $2,400 mark in the early days of February, has seen a significant influx of buying pressure, leading to a breakthrough past key resistance levels. This positive price action posits two potential scenarios for the smart contract giant.

In one scenario, Ethereum could continue its aggressive push, riding the wave of current market optimism towards the $3,000 target. If this momentum is maintained, and with the additional fuel from the recent high volume of trades, ETH could test $3,000 in the coming days. A consolidation above $2,600 would be crucial for this scenario to unfold, as it would establish a new support level, reinforcing investor confidence.

Alternatively, given the volatile nature of the crypto markets, a retracement could occur before Ethereum reaches $3,000. This would likely see the asset retesting support at the $2,500 level, which if held, could serve as a springboard for a second wave towards and beyond $3,000.

"Shiba Inu (SHIB) Becoming Bullish, Ethereum (ETH) Price Screams Rally Continuation, Bitcoin (BTC) Not Giving up Market Dominance","U.Today - Shiba Inu currently displays an ascending triangle pattern on the SHIB/USDT chart. This technical formation is widely recognized and could be a signal to a significant price surge for the meme.

An ascending triangle is characterized by a flat upper resistance line and a rising lower support line. This pattern suggests that buyers are gradually gaining ground against sellers, as each dip is bought up at a higher level than the previous one, indicating accumulating pressure for an upward breakout.

SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewFor Shiba Inu, which has been lingering in a period of relatively nonexistent activity, this pattern could serve as massive fuel for volatility in the near future. Recent market conditions have seen a decline in interest toward legacy meme coins, with SHIB being no exception. The lack of significant developments within the Shiba Inu network has contributed to the muted activity around this cryptocurrency.

In contrast, the majority of the action in the meme coin sector has been taking place on the Solana network. This platform has become a hotbed for the deployment of new meme coins, which are exhibiting far greater volatility than those on the Ethereum network, where Shiba Inu resides. The brisk activity on Solana contrasts sharply with the sluggishness observed in Ethereum's meme coin space, drawing in traders and investors looking for quick gains and high excitement.

Ethereum's correction is temporary
The Ethereum market is currently exhibiting a correction, and there are patterns that suggest a rally may not only be on the horizon but could also be in continuation. The asset has recently experienced a sharp downturn, movement that is readily apparent on intraday timeframes. However, such stark movements are often precursors to reversals, signaling that Ethereum could be gearing up for an upswing.
A closer look at the charts shows Ethereum's price action respecting a series of key technical indicators which, together, build a case for potential upward momentum. The asset has been tracing back to touch base with its moving averages, a behavior that is typically followed by a rebound, as these levels can act as dynamic support zones.

This corrective phase is noteworthy, especially considering the robust rally Ethereum enjoyed in the preceding weeks. Corrections are a natural and healthy part of any asset's price trajectory, allowing for consolidation before the next leg up. For Ethereum, the current pullback could be shaking out weak hands, setting the stage for a stronger rally propelled by a more committed investor base.

Bitcoin's dominance not going anywhere
After a brief breach below the 50-day EMA — a critical indicator of medium-term market sentiment — Bitcoin has clawed its way back above this pivotal level. This move indicates a bullish signal for market observers, suggesting that Bitcoin is not yet ready to relinquish its market dominance.
However, the ascent above the 50 EMA has not been met with the kind of vigorous momentum that bulls would hope for. The growth has been moderate, hinting that Bitcoin might encounter selling pressure as it ascends. This is not unusual on the crypto markets, where significant moves often face immediate resistance as traders take profits and skeptics cast doubts.

The recent price action has been a roller coaster for Bitcoin, which saw its value tumble from highs around $47,000 to lows near $41,000. This downturn briefly shifted the spotlight to altcoins, which seized the moment to stage local rallies. The diversification of gains across the crypto spectrum during Bitcoin's periods of weakness is a trend that has become more pronounced as the overall market matures.

Yet Bitcoin's ability to push back above the 50 EMA serves as a reminder of its underlying strength and the confidence investors have placed in it. Despite the opportunity for altcoins to rise, Bitcoin remains the anchor of the crypto market, with its moves often dictating broader market sentiment. This recent rebound above a crucial technical level could be interpreted as Bitcoin's silent assertion that it is not ready to give up the throne just yet.

"XRP Starts Moving Earlier, Solana (SOL) Already Stronger Than Everyone Else; Does Ethereum (ETH) Need More Fuel?","U.Today - XRP appears to have begun its market movements earlier than anticipated. The chart shows a notable shift from the recent sideways trading pattern, as XRP starts to carve out a new direction.

As of the latest trends, XRP has been testing the support level around $0.50, a crucial psychological threshold for the asset. A sustained move below this level could signal further bearish momentum, potentially leading the price to test the next significant support zone around $0.47.

XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewOn the flip side, if XRP manages to stabilize and bounce back from the current support, the initial resistance is likely to be encountered near the $0.54 mark, where the 50-day moving average currently lies. This moving average has historically acted as a dynamic resistance level, and a breakout above could propel XRP toward the $0.56 level, which aligns with the 100-day moving average.

Further complicating the chart is the downward trendline that has been in play since the local high established in November. This trendline has repeatedly acted as resistance, pushing the price downward each time it has been tested. For a true reversal to be confirmed, XRP would need to break above this trendline with significant volume to validate the move.

Solana is leading pack
Solana is manifesting its strength as the top performer among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Despite overall market volatility, SOL's price action has been signaling a stronger recovery compared to other assets.
At the time of analysis, Solana is trading around the $90 mark, having rebounded with considerable momentum from the support level near $78.35. This pivotal point, bolstered by the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), has served as a springboard for the recent bullish trend. The price of SOL has been consistently creating higher lows, indicative of strong buying interest at these levels.

Resistance for SOL is currently looming at the $100 psychological level, a breakthrough of which could propel the price toward the next significant resistance at $110.

The relative strength of Solana is further substantiated by the resurgence of a risk appetite on the market, particularly evidenced by the blossoming of meme coins. This renewed interest in higher-risk assets typically bodes well for ecosystems like Solana that support a variety of decentralized applications and niche crypto projects.

Ethereum needs push
The Ethereum market is currently facing a confluence of challenges as it searches for the momentum to sustain its position. A recent chart analysis reveals an indecisive atmosphere among investors, with Ethereum struggling to find a strong directional move.
At present, Ethereum is hovering around the $2,200 mark, a level that has seen significant activity and is currently acting as a temporary support. However, the lack of bullish conviction suggests that this support level may not hold if a new wave of selling pressure emerges.

Resistance levels are observed near the $2,400 range, where previous attempts to break higher have been met with a firm rejection, indicating a substantial barrier to upward movement.

The selling pressure is partly attributed to the recent news of Celsius Network liquidating approximately $1 billion worth of Ethereum holdings. This substantial amount has the potential to saturate the market, overwhelming current liquidity and triggering a downturn. As a result, the $2,000 psychological level is eyed as the next critical support zone, a breach of which could see a sharp decline toward the $1,950 region, where the 200-day moving average lies, providing stronger historical support.

On the flip side, if Ethereum can absorb the selling pressure and gain the necessary ""fuel,"" a push above the $2,400 resistance could open the path toward the $2,500 area before challenging the more formidable resistance at $2,600, which aligns with the 50-day moving average.

This trendline has repeatedly acted as resistance, pushing the price downward each time it has been tested. For a true reversal to be confirmed, XRP would need to break above this trendline with significant volume to validate the move.

Solana is leading pack
Solana is manifesting its strength as the top performer among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Despite overall market volatility, SOL's price action has been signaling a stronger recovery compared to other assets.
At the time of analysis, Solana is trading around the $90 mark, having rebounded with considerable momentum from the support level near $78.35. This pivotal point, bolstered by the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), has served as a springboard for the recent bullish trend. The price of SOL has been consistently creating higher lows, indicative of strong buying interest at these levels.

Resistance for SOL is currently looming at the $100 psychological level, a breakthrough of which could propel the price toward the next significant resistance at $110.

The relative strength of Solana is further substantiated by the resurgence of a risk appetite on the market, particularly evidenced by the blossoming of meme coins. This renewed interest in higher-risk assets typically bodes well for ecosystems like Solana that support a variety of decentralized applications and niche crypto projects.

Ethereum needs push
The Ethereum market is currently facing a confluence of challenges as it searches for the momentum to sustain its position. A recent chart analysis reveals an indecisive atmosphere among investors, with Ethereum struggling to find a strong directional move.
At present, Ethereum is hovering around the $2,200 mark, a level that has seen significant activity and is currently acting as a temporary support. However, the lack of bullish conviction suggests that this support level may not hold if a new wave of selling pressure emerges.

Resistance levels are observed near the $2,400 range, where previous attempts to break higher have been met with a firm rejection, indicating a substantial barrier to upward movement.

The selling pressure is partly attributed to the recent news of Celsius Network liquidating approximately $1 billion worth of Ethereum holdings. This substantial amount has the potential to saturate the market, overwhelming current liquidity and triggering a downturn. As a result, the $2,000 psychological level is eyed as the next critical support zone, a breach of which could see a sharp decline toward the $1,950 region, where the 200-day moving average lies, providing stronger historical support.

On the flip side, if Ethereum can absorb the selling pressure and gain the necessary ""fuel,"" a push above the $2,400 resistance could open the path toward the $2,500 area before challenging the more formidable resistance at $2,600, which aligns with the 50-day moving average.

"Ethereum (ETH) Loses All of Its Gains, Bitcoin (BTC) Not Ready to Give up $40,000, Solana (SOL) Comeback Starts","U.Today - Ethereum has wiped out the gains it had accumulated over a sustained period. The ETH/USD price chart depicts a grim narrative as the digital asset has swiftly descended from its peak, retracing back to levels that question the sustainability of its prior growth.

The steep decline in Ethereum's price is a significant bearish signal. It reflects the market's hesitancy to invest at previous highs, most likely due to the underperformance Ethereum has shown in the recent past. This lack of traction and inability to initiate a recovery underscores the vulnerability of Ethereum's price in the current market climate.

ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewFocusing on the technical aspects, Ethereum has broken through what was once seen as a strong support level at approximately $2,350. This price point, which previously saw substantial buying interest, has now been breached, leading to a cascading effect as the asset searches for new support. The next critical support level is around $2,175, where buyers might emerge to stall the downfall.

Conversely, any attempts at recovery will first encounter resistance at around $2,338, a level that now marks the lower boundary of what was a consolidation range before the drop. A close above this level on significant volume could signal a temporary respite from selling pressure. However, the real test lies at higher resistance levels, previously established around $2,500, where ETH struggled to maintain upward momentum.

Bitcoin ready to fight
Recent candlestick formations portray a scenario where Bitcoin is flirting with a critical resistance level, poised to either confirm a bearish trend or start a substantial recovery.
The chart illustrates Bitcoin’s recent descent, as it lost its foothold at the higher price echelons it previously occupied. However, amid this downward movement, Bitcoin is showing signs of resilience. The latest candles indicate a potential reversal as they hover around a significant support level, which can be identified at approximately $37,000, a region where buyers have historically stepped in.

A sustained hold above this point could catalyze renewed buying interest, which may drive the price toward the immediate resistance level at around $41,000. The significance of reclaiming this threshold cannot be understated, as it may invalidate the bearish outlook and signal a trend reversal.

As for the upper resistances, the $43,000 and $46,000 price levels stand out as notable barriers that Bitcoin would need to breach to cement a robust recovery narrative. Achieving such milestones could sway market sentiment positively, potentially ushering in a wave of optimism among investors.

The moving averages offer additional insight, suggesting a possible bullish crossover should the current momentum persist. This scenario would be further supported by a rise in trading volume, which typically accompanies decisive trend shifts.

Solana among leaders
Solana shows signs of a nascent comeback, presenting a bullish scenario amid a broader market recovery. However, investors tread cautiously, aware of the potential of a ""dead cat bounce"" since volume profiles signal restraint.
Analyzing the SOL/USDT chart, we notice that Solana has established a local support level around the $70 price mark. This is characterized by multiple touches of this level over the past few weeks, each time resisting further downward movement.

On the flip side, the local resistance can be identified near the $96 level, which previously acted as support during Solana's consistent upward trend.

The price movement is currently sandwiched between the 50-day moving average acting as dynamic resistance and the 200-day moving average serving as potential dynamic support. The narrowing gap between these averages could squeeze the price action, possibly leading to a volatility breakout.

"Dogecoin (DOGE) Breakout Occurs, What's Next? Solana (SOL) Stays Dominant, Will Ethereum (ETH) Survive Unseen Stalemate?","U.Today - Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency that started as a joke but became a favorite of the masses, including Elon Musk, has recently experienced a significant breakout.

After a period of consolidation, DOGE has broken past a critical resistance level, stirring excitement among traders and investors. The coin is currently sitting above the $0.088 mark, which previously acted as substantial resistance. If DOGE manages to maintain its position above this level, it could solidify this area as new support.

Dogecoin/USDT Chart by TradingViewA break above the $0.095 resistance could signal a continued bullish trend, potentially leading Dogecoin to test the psychological barrier of $0.10. If the momentum is sustained and market sentiment remains positive, DOGE could attempt to reach higher highs, possibly moving toward the $0.105 to $0.11 range last seen during its peak periods of trading activity.

Immediate support for DOGE is now at $0.088 which, if held, could act as a springboard for further climbs. However, should Dogecoin fail to maintain this level, it might fall back to its previous support near $0.078, where buyers have historically shown interest.

A scenario where DOGE's breakout continues would likely involve increased adoption news or a resurgence of interest in meme coins, potentially sparked by social media or celebrity endorsements. Such catalysts could drive demand and push DOGE past the $0.095 level, cementing its breakout status.

Conversely, if the breakout fails to sustain, perhaps due to broader market bearishness or fading interest, DOGE could slide back below $0.088. This would retest the resilience of the $0.078 support. A drop below this level could lead to a bearish phase, with DOGE potentially seeking lower ground.

Solana shows strength
During this market cycle, Solana has established itself as a leader. With its stable and easily scalable performance, it outpaces giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as the majority of DeFi volume went to the ""Ethereum killer.""
As the DeFi ecosystem on Solana flourishes, it is becoming a hub for innovation, blending meme culture with decentralized applications. The network's efficiency and scalability are attracting a wide array of developers.

The cryptocurrency that has been on a strong upward trajectory. Currently, Solana is testing a resistance level at approximately $100, a significant psychological and technical barrier. A convincing break above this level could signal continued bullish momentum, potentially leading to testing the next resistance zone around $108, which coincides with recent highs.

On the downside, the 50-day moving average, sitting near $93.23, is providing dynamic support. This level has been defended multiple times, indicating its importance to traders. If Solana can maintain its footing above this moving average, it would reinforce the asset's stability and could serve as a springboard for further gains.

The next crucial test for Solana will be sustaining above $100. Should it consolidate above this level, it would not be unrealistic to envision a push toward $108, or even higher, as the market reassesses Solana's value proposition in the context of a rapidly evolving DeFi and NFT landscape.

Fundamental Ethereum problems
As it struggles to gain momentum, Ethereum's scalability suffering and the diminishing traction of meme coins on its network are at the forefront of the bearish case for the second-biggest cryptocurrency on the market.
The network's inability to handle high transaction volumes without exorbitant fees has led to the sentiment that Ethereum is becoming ""unusable"" for the day-to-day transactions that meme coins require.

From a technical standpoint, Ethereum's price analysis paints a picture of uncertainty. The asset has been struggling to maintain momentum above crucial support levels. Currently, Ethereum is wavering around the $2,250 mark, with immediate support near the $2,150 level. A break below this support could see a decline toward the $2,000 psychological barrier, which would represent a significant bearish development.

Layer-2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum have emerged as potential stopgaps, offering faster and cheaper transactions. However, their adoption has been less than stellar, with many viewing these platforms as temporary fixes rather than a comprehensive solution to Ethereum's underlying scalability problems.

"Arbitrum (ARB) Rally Halted, Ethereum (ETH) Makes Important Reminder, Did Solana (SOL) Hit Ceiling?","U.Today - The leading layer-2 solution in the Ethereum ecosystem, Arbitrum, has recently seen a significant rally, but this has been interrupted, indicating a potential reversal in its price trajectory.

ARB's price movement had been bullish, as evidenced by its ascent past the moving averages, which served as dynamic support levels during its uptrend. However, the price has encountered substantial resistance, leading to a halt in its rally.

ARB/USDT Chart by TradingViewThe chart demonstrates ARB's struggle to maintain its upward momentum, with the token facing a critical resistance level at approximately $2.00. After failing to breach this threshold, ARB experienced a pullback, currently trading around $1.80.

The support levels to watch are strategically positioned at $1.68 and $1.47, which could provide a safety net for the price if the downward pressure persists. It may also find a stronger base at $1.32, a level that could be fundamental for buyers to reenter the market. Conversely, a bounce off the support could signal a potential for growth, with a retest of the $2.00 resistance level and possible breakout.

Ethereum shows some aggression
As the cryptocurrency market continues its dynamic ebb and flow, Ethereum (ETH) provides a salient reminder of its resilience and potential for growth. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has recently seen a reversal in its price, suggesting a potential shift in market sentiment and positioning.
The price analysis of Ethereum shows a significant level of activity around the $2,400 price point, suggesting this is a key resistance level. After a period of upward movement, ETH's price action indicates a halt and potential retracement from this level. This movement could be indicative of the market catching its breath after a period of accumulation.

Despite ETH's uptick in movement, it has not mirrored the performance of some of its contemporaries like Solana, or even Bitcoin. While these cryptocurrencies have seen more robust growth, Ethereum's progression appears more measured, possibly due to its already substantial market penetration and the maturation of its ecosystem.

The support levels for Ethereum stand firmly at around $2,197 and $2,033, which are crucial if Ethereum were to sustain a further drop in price. These levels may act as a springboard for price recovery should market conditions remain favorable. Conversely, the resistance level at approximately $2,400 is proving to be a formidable barrier to overcome.

The current technical outlook suggests Ethereum may indeed rally to test the $2,400 resistance level again. However, investors should be prepared for a possible retracement following this test. The interplay of support and resistance levels will be crucial in determining ETH's price trajectory in the short term.

Solana's rally on pause?
Solana has recently hit a metaphorical ceiling, as the fervor around the DeFi industry and meme coins that once propelled its value upward has begun to decline. This cooling on the NFT market has contributed to the deceleration in SOL's price momentum, as evidenced by the latest price charts.
A close analysis of the SOL price chart indicates a reversal from its upward trajectory, with the asset facing resistance at approximately $101. The resistance level has proven to be a formidable barrier, with Solana struggling to maintain the bullish momentum it had gained in the past.

Support levels for Solana are observed around the $94 and $76 marks. These levels may offer some respite to the asset’s price if the downward pressure continues. If Solana dips to these support levels and holds, it could signal the potential for recovery and another attempt to break through the current resistance.

Despite the recent slowdown, Solana has indeed had an impressive run. Its ecosystem continues to develop, and while the immediate future may not look as bright as it once did, the possibility of a rebound remains. The market’s cyclical nature and the potential for innovation within Solana’s platform could provide the necessary catalyst for another period of growth.

Ethereum (ETH) Staking Ratio Surprisingly Keeps Surging Despite Shapella,"U.Today - Ki Young Ju, founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, leading on-chain analytical firm, shared his views on the Ethereum (ETH) staking progress. He admits he was wrong about Shapella hard fork's effects.

Ethereum (ETH) staking ratio surges to 24% and counting
Ethereum (ETH) staking ratio, i.e., the percentage of ETH coins locked in staking, reaches 24% and keeps surging. Meanwhile, only 11% of the ETH supply is stored on centralized exchanges. The data was shared by Ki Young Ju on X today, on Jan. 18, 2024.
As such, it is safe to say that the overhyped Ethereum (ETH) upgrade Shapella that allowed stakers to withdraw their coins for the first time since December 2020 did not result in massive unstaking:

Ethereum's (ETH) Shapella was activated in April 2023. As crypto markets were still dominated by bearish sentiment, analysts were expecting withdrawals and consecutive sell-offs of Ethereum (ETH).

The Ethereum (ETH) price also managed to go through this event without significant losses: as stakers withdrew 1 million Ethers (ETH) in first week post-Shapella, the ETH price was fluctuating between $2,000 and $2,100.

Staked Ethereums (ETH) are mostly profitable, Mr. Ki Young Ju adds. While the realized price for staking inflows is $2,014, the current ETH rate is $2,519. As such, the average Ether ""stake"" is being held with a significant 25% profit.

The aggregated volume of the Ethereum (ETH) staking ecosystem is estimated at a whopping $72 billion, with 4.25% in APY, Staking Rewards data says.

Сardano (ADA) staking close to surpassing Solana (SOL)
At the same time, the largest Ethereum (ETH) competitors might be close to a historic ""flippening."" The Solana (SOL) staking ratio is plummeting. The indicator lost over 20% in the last week and dipped below 67%.
Meanwhile, the Cardano (ADA) staking ecosystem added 0.06% in the last seven days and is getting closer to 64%. At the same time, the USD-denominated volume of Solana (SOL) staking is over 200% larger than that of Cardano (ADA).

Out of all mainstream altcoins, Mina Protocol (MINA) demonstrates the largest staking ratio: its stakers locked over 91% of the circulating supply.

Aptos (APT) and Sui (SUI) follow the Mina Protocol (MINA) with 85%-86% in staking ratio.

"Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin Makes Surprising Visit to Binance, SHIB Rep Shares Shibarium's Plans to Onboard Thousands of Projects: Crypto News Digest by U.Today","U.Today - Take a look at the most important crypto events with U.Today's top three news stories.

Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin makes surprising visit to Binance
As has been recently shared by Binance CEO Richard Teng on the X platform, Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin made a surprising visit to the Binance office. Teng thanked Buterin for finding time to speak to his team in person, saying that it was a privilege to have him in the company's office. This spontaneous visit caused quite a stir in the crypto community, with many users speculating about a potential collaboration between these two giants of the crypto market. As a reminder, Binance is currently struggling with a $4 billion fine and ongoing regulatory challenges; considering this, Buterin's focus (described in his essay entitled ""Make Ethereum Cypherpunk Again"") on security, privacy and scalability, and concern for centralized exchanges and their vulnerability to hacking, feed rumors about possible cooperation between Buterin and Binance.

In a recent X post, Shiba Inu team member Lucie shared Shibarium's plans for the future. Lucie wrote that the layer-2 solution aims to ""onboard 1,000 projects with numerous partnerships,"" reminding the community that supporting new projects does not necessarily mean canceling existing ones. The SHIB representative then called on all meme token supporters to stay strong as a community during challenging times, stating that there is hardly any point in giving up now if they got ""this far"" in their support for the project's team. Lucie's post has evoked mixed reactions among SHIB army members; even though many of them praised the SHIB developers, some users questioned the project team's ability to accomplish anything more than just making plans and promising new advances.
JPMorgan: Bitcoin ETF hype cooling
According to Kenneth Worthington, analyst at JPMorgan, the initial enthusiasm surrounding Bitcoin ETFs may be waning, with a shift toward a ""more normalized flow environment"" being potentially on the horizon. On Jan. 26, spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced net sales of about $15 million following a four-day streak of redemptions. This reversal could be an indication of changing investor sentiment on these novel financial products. Since their launch, the Bitcoin price has plunged by about 9% but has since stabilized around $42,000 as the new trading week gets underway. Previously, JPMorgan correctly predicted that the approval of Bitcoin ETFs would be a sell-the-news event. Before the approval, the price of the leading cryptocurrency dropped from above $47,000 to below $39,000. The sell-off coincided with large outflows from Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which transitioned into a spot Bitcoin ETF after the SEC's approval.

Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin makes surprising visit to Binance
As has been recently shared by Binance CEO Richard Teng on the X platform, Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin made a surprising visit to the Binance office. Teng thanked Buterin for finding time to speak to his team in person, saying that it was a privilege to have him in the company's office. This spontaneous visit caused quite a stir in the crypto community, with many users speculating about a potential collaboration between these two giants of the crypto market. As a reminder, Binance is currently struggling with a $4 billion fine and ongoing regulatory challenges; considering this, Buterin's focus (described in his essay entitled ""Make Ethereum Cypherpunk Again"") on security, privacy and scalability, and concern for centralized exchanges and their vulnerability to hacking, feed rumors about possible cooperation between Buterin and Binance. However, neither Buterin nor Teng made any statements in this regard.

"Samson Mow Issues Ultra-Bullish Bitcoin Statement, Dogecoin Whale Moves 332.9 Million DOGE to Binance, Michaël van de Poppe Predicts Bullish Breakout for ETH: Crypto News Digest by U.Today","U.Today - U.Today has prepared a summary of the top three news stories over the past day.

Ultra-bullish Bitcoin statement made by Samson Mow ahead of possible ETF approval
As the crypto community is eagerly awaiting the SEC's decision regarding the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, Bitcoin maximalist Samson Mow took to X platform to share his mega-bullish expectations on BTC's price movement. According to Mow, Bitcoin reaching $1 million may happen any day from now, and this sudden price surge will be “max pain” for most market participants. He explained that many companies, including his own, Jan3, have many plans and meetings scheduled for the year 2024, and should Bitcoin spike to $1 million, it would “derail everything.” Apart from Jan3, Mow named other big figures in the crypto space who would see their plans collapse in the event that BTC suddenly reached $1 million: analyst Plan B and his stock-to-flow model for Bitcoin, MicroStrategy with its goal to accumulate 1% of the Bitcoin supply and El Salvador, as it would not be able to issue Bitcoin bonds and buy more BTC below the $100,000 level.
Dogecoin (DOGE) whale transfers 332.9 million DOGE to Binance
According to data provided by Whale Alert's X account, yesterday, a Dogecoin (DOGE) whale moved a large amount of dog-themed tokens to Binance. The transaction carried 332,931,620 DOGE (worth $26,612,151 at the time of transfer) from an unknown wallet to the aforementioned major exchange. It remains unclear what motivated the whale to make such a significant transfer, and Dogecoin enthusiasts are speculating about its potential implications for the broader DOGE ecosystem. Meanwhile, DOGE has seen a decline in its value, going down by 21.98% over the past 30 days. The Dogecoin community is looking forward to further developments, both in terms of the whale's activities and the impact of the recent lunar launch on DOGE's market dynamics. As a reminder, on Jan. 8, a real replica of the dog-themed token was sent to the moon onboard the Vulcan Centaur rocket.
Ethereum (ETH) at critical juncture as Michaël van de Poppe predicts bullish breakout
In a recent X post, renowned crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe made a prediction about a potential bullish breakout for Ethereum (ETH), as the second-largest cryptocurrency currently finds itself in a critical position. According to van de Poppe, ETH is approaching the low of 2022 and is likely to take liquidity at that level. The analyst believes that in case a spot Bitcoin ETF gets approved by the SEC, there would potentially be a liquidation candle on the trading chart for the ETH/BTC trading pair. After this, van de Poppe foresees a rotation of funds into Ethereum, along with a bullish weekly divergence. Michaël Van de Poppe's forecast is predicated on the idea that Ethereum could see a significant rise in response to the approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF. Thus, traders are keeping a close eye on the upcoming Bitcoin ETF decision, recognizing the interconnected nature of cryptocurrencies.

"Ethereum (ETH) Jumps 11.4%, Here's How Whales Are Changing Game","U.Today - There is ongoing mega accumulation of Ethereum (ETH) by whales within the crypto ecosystem. According to data from the crypto analytics platform Lookonchain, a whale with the wallet address ""0xAA15"" withdrew a total of 5,762 ETH worth approximately $15.06 million from Binance earlier today. Overall, this whale has bought a total of 50,733 ETH $99.2 million at an average price of $1,955 since Sept. 19, 2023.

Per the Lookonchain outlook, another whale, ""0x9314"" also spent 7.29 million USDT to buy 2,800 ETH today, joining the host of accumulations of the second-largest cryptocurrency about two hours ago. This particular whale has a more robust portfolio, having stacked up a total of 82,780 ETH worth approximately $150.3 million at an average price of $1,816 since Jan 1, 2023.

The intriguing switch to Ethereum by these whales complements the $8.2 billion in large transaction volumes according to data from IntoTheBlock. These large transactions, which involve ETH worth at least $100,000, have jumped by 65.99% in the past 24 hours.

Ethereum’s whales are notably helping to change the game as the digital currency strives to recoup its lost ground to price action.

Ethereum price in mix
At the time of writing, Ethereum has jumped by 11.42% in the past 24 hours to $2,645.07. The cryptocurrency has grown from a 24-hour low of $2,353.93 to its price at the moment, driven in part by the hype ravaging the market following the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
This approval is boosting sentiment that the spot Ethereum ETF might also be on the way. This has further pushed retail sentiment as well, with Ethereum now notably eyeing the $2,700 benchmark.

"Here's Who Burned 9,001 ETH in Last 30 Days","U.Today - Uniswap, the world’s largest decentralized exchange, is apparently a top burner of Ethereum, with a staggering 9,001 ETH incinerated from the circulating supply in the last 30 days. This activity firmly positions Uniswap as a key player in the Ethereum ecosystem, not just in terms of volume but also in influencing the coin's scarcity.

The mechanism behind Ethereum's burn is a recent upgrade known as EIP-1559, which introduced a transaction fee burn for every operation made on the network. Uniswap, as the leading DEX, handles a massive volume of transactions, naturally leading to a higher rate of ETH being burned. This burn acts as a deflationary force on the supply of Ethereum, theoretically creating scarcity that could bolster the asset's value over the long term.

ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewHowever, the correlation between burn rate and immediate price action is not linear. While Uniswap's significant contribution to the burn rate underscores its dominance, the short-term impact on Ethereum’s price is subdued. Over a longer horizon, this deflationary mechanism is expected to establish a supportive base for the price of ETH, as reducing supply, ceteris paribus, should increase the value of each remaining ETH.

It is important to note, though, that scarcity alone does not guarantee value growth. The intrinsic value of Ethereum also hinges on its utility, adoption and broader market sentiment. Currently, Ethereum is facing stiff competition from Solana in ecosystem growth, with many traders who favor volatility and risk gravitating toward Solana.

A technical analysis of Ethereum's current price action shows a challenging market phase. Ethereum is attempting to hold support around the $2,400 level. Should it fail to sustain this, the next key support is observed at the $2,300 mark, near the 50-day EMA. A breach below this could see Ethereum test the $2,000 psychological support level. Conversely, if Ethereum can rally past the immediate resistance at $2,500, it could pave the way to retest previous highs near $2,800.

Vitalik Buterin Answers Major Bitcoin and Ethereum Question in Birthday Essay,"U.Today - Renowned Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin celebrated his 30 birthday today by releasing a thoughtful essay titled ""The End of My Childhood."" The essay delves into the genesis of cryptocurrencies, and Bitcoin in particular, underscoring its initial purpose as a response to the vulnerabilities of traditional banking systems.

In his reflective piece, Buterin questions the evolution of public discourse within the crypto space over the past 15 years, pondering whether the original narrative emphasizing financial disruption has waned. To address this, he proposes two pragmatic approaches for the crypto ecosystem.

First, Buterin advocates for a renewed emphasis on the significance of money and finance, urging the crypto space to actively contribute to serving underserved populations and fostering financial inclusion. Second, he envisions a broader role for crypto that extends beyond finance.

Highlighting the unique decentralized nature of the crypto industry, Buterin notes that developers are dispersed globally, and many major crypto projects are not bound by geographical constraints. He emphasizes the potential of non-Western developers to understand and address the concrete needs of users in low-income countries.

Ideal reality by Vitalik Buterin
Buterin's vision for Ethereum goes beyond financial applications. He envisions ETH as the foundation for a decentralized tech stack, emphasizing trustworthiness, democracy and privacy. Zero-knowledge proofs are identified as a key innovation in achieving these goals, offering a nuanced approach to issues of authenticity, manipulation and privacy.
Source: ""The end of my childhood"" by Vitalik ButerinIn addition to Ethereum's role as a financial platform, Buterin encourages the community to broaden its focus, positioning his brainchild as a competitive force against centralized tech companies.

The essay articulates a nuanced perspective on the roles of token holders, intellectuals, builders and pragmatic users within the crypto ecosystem, highlighting the need for collaboration and understanding between these groups.

"Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin Makes Surprising Visit to Binance, New CEO Richard Teng Shares","U.Today - In an unexpected turn of events, Ethereum (ETH) cofounder and prominent figure in the cryptocurrency industry, Vitalik Buterin, paid a surprise visit to the Binance office. The revelation came from the CEO of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, Richard Teng, who shared the news on his X page.

Teng expressed his gratitude for the privilege of hosting Buterin.

The impromptu meeting sparked a flurry of speculation within the crypto community, as enthusiasts and experts alike pondered the potential collaboration between these two giants of the crypto market. Notably, Binance has been grappling with heightened regulatory scrutiny in recent months, leading to the legal predicament of its former CEO, Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao.

Vitalik and Binance connections
This unexpected rendezvous holds significance, given Buterin and Binance's history of active collaboration, such as Buterin's contribution to the proof-of-reserves concept for centralized crypto exchanges just two years ago. Against the backdrop of Binance's $4 billion fine and ongoing regulatory challenges, the nature of the discussions between Buterin and the Binance team remains shrouded in mystery.
Vitalik Buterin's recent focus, as evident in his essay titled ""Make Ethereum Cypherpunk Again,"" centers on security, privacy and scalability. Notably, he addressed concerns about centralized exchanges and their vulnerability to hacking — a topic that adds fuel to the speculation of potential collaborative efforts between Buterin and Binance.

As the crypto community eagerly awaits further developments, the surprise visit has sparked intense discussions about the future direction of these industry heavyweights.

Major FED Decision to Affect Crypto Market in Two Days,"U.Today - The crypto market is bracing itself as the Federal Reserve gears up to announce its first interest rate decision of 2024. The whispers from the CME about a 96.9% chance to keep interest rates unchanged are causing ripples. Yet, with the second decision in March casting a 47% shadow of a rate cut by 25 basis points (bps), investors are on edge. Adding to the economic fervor, the United States is set to release the January unemployment rate, which could further sway market sentiment.

The Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates is a critical economic lever that traditionally influences traditional markets and, as has been seen, the cryptocurrency market as well. An unchanged interest rate could maintain the status quo, possibly keeping investment steady in assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

A cut, however, could signal economic caution, potentially reducing the attractiveness of risk assets like cryptocurrencies or, conversely, could lead investors to seek higher returns in the crypto market if traditional investments falter.

BTC/USD Chart by TradingViewAnalyzing the Bitcoin chart, there is a distinctive ""war"" between the bulls and bears. The immediate resistance level to watch is around the $42,500 mark, which Bitcoin has been testing recently. This level is crucial because a decisive close above it could signal increasing bullish momentum. On the downside, the support level at approximately $39,528, aligning with a psychological round number and a previous area of interest, is one that traders are likely to defend vigorously.

The upcoming Fed decision could serve as a catalyst for Bitcoin's next big move. If interest rates remain unchanged, Bitcoin could continue to test the resistance level, and a break above could confirm a bullish reversal. However, should rates decrease, Bitcoin's reaction might be even more unpredictable.

"Shiba Inu (SHIB) Rapidly Breaks Down, Ethereum (ETH) Loses Traction, While Solana (SOL) Presents Hidden Opportunity","U.Today - Shiba Inu has experienced a significant breakdown from its recent consolidation phase. The chart depicts a clear downward trajectory as SHIB failed to maintain its position within the ascending triangle pattern it had formed over the past few months.

The breakdown was signaled as SHIB prices breached the key support level at $0.000009, which had previously acted as a reliable floor for the price during consolidation phases. Following this, SHIB prices tumbled further, slicing through subsequent support near $0.0000087. This price action marked a decisive shift in market sentiment from accumulation to distribution.

SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewThe next support level to watch is at $0.0000082, where SHIB may find a temporary reprieve from the selling pressure. If this level fails to hold, the next critical support lies at $0.0000076, which could serve as the last line of defense before a more significant drop.

For a reversal to occur and for SHIB to regain its upward momentum, it would need to reclaim previous support levels and transform them back into supports. This would require a substantial influx of buying pressure, potentially sparked by positive developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem or broader cryptocurrency market rallies.

The first sign of a possible reversal would be a return above $0.0000087, followed by a sustained move above the $0.000009 price level. A breakout above these levels, accompanied by increasing volume, could indicate that the downtrend is losing steam and that bulls are regaining control.

Solana paints reversal pattern
Solana has been developing a subtle yet potentially pivotal chart pattern. The asset has been tracing a slow and steady ascending channel, a formation that suggests a controlled and consistent uptrend. This pattern, characterized by higher lows and higher highs contained within two parallel trendlines, speaks to potential for continued growth.
The significance of this pattern lies in the momentum it could provide for SOL. Should the price action remain strong within the upper half of the channel, and particularly if it challenges the upper trendline, we could see Solana break through and embark on a more aggressive rally.

Such a bullish scenario would likely be supported by increased trading volume and positive developments within the Solana ecosystem, such as new project launches or updates that enhance network performance.

The immediate local resistance stands at around $55, and a confident push beyond this could confirm bullish sentiment. Inversely, if Solana's price dips below the channel's lower boundary, around $48, it could indicate that a bearish narrative is taking hold.

Ethereum momentum decreasing
Ethereum is exhibiting signs of waning momentum, as observed in recent price movements. The asset, which has long been considered the backbone of the decentralized finance sector, is facing a pivotal moment that could determine its trajectory for the coming weeks.
The provided chart illustrates Ethereum's struggle to maintain its grasp on the market. The price has been on a downward trend, edging closer to the local 26-day Exponential Moving Average. This level, currently near $2,465, is critical; if Ethereum fails to hold this line, we might see it descend to test the more significant 50 EMA, which stands around the $2,300 mark.

The 26 EMA serves as a short-term sentiment gauge, and its breach could signal a lack of immediate bullish support. Should this level fail to act as a springboard for price recovery, Ethereum's next stop could indeed be the 50 EMA. A breach below this longer-term moving average could potentially open the gates for a test of lower support levels, highlighting the need for investors to brace for more volatility.

Market participants are now recalibrating their expectations, understanding that the road to sustainable gains is a long-term journey.

The breakdown was signaled as SHIB prices breached the key support level at $0.000009, which had previously acted as a reliable floor for the price during consolidation phases.

"XRP's Epic Battle Against Bears, Solana Breaks $100, While Ethereum Fights for Momentum","U.Today - XRP is currently locked in a fierce struggle with bearish forces. The digital asset, which operates within the Ripple network, is experiencing difficulty establishing a position above a critical technical indicator — the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).

The 200 EMA serves as an important barometer for the long-term trend and investor sentiment. For XRP, remaining below this level suggests that the asset lacks the bullish momentum needed to shift into an upward trajectory. This inability to secure a foothold above the 200 EMA raises questions about the stability of positive price action in the near term.

XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewTechnical analysis shows that the 200 EMA is a dynamic level of resistance that many traders watch closely. A consistent failure to breach this mark can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy where the resistance level grows stronger, as more traders set their sell orders around this key price point.

Ethereum keeps on struggling
Ethereum is showing signs of losing its upward momentum, failing to form a higher high — an indicator that market experts often interpret as a sign of an impending price correction.
The ETH chart reveals a telling pattern; the absence of a new higher high is significant. Typically, in a bullish market phase, the price of an asset creates a series of higher highs and higher lows. However, Ethereum's inability to push beyond its recent peak may suggest that the bulls are running out of steam and a reevaluation of market sentiment could be underway.

Analyzing the chart, the local resistance level has been a tough ceiling for Ethereum to break. This resistance, where sell orders tend to cluster, is acting as a barrier preventing further upward movement. On the flip side, the support level represents a price point with a concentration of buy orders, offering a potential cushion against a price drop. If Ethereum fails to uphold the support level, it could trigger a price breakdown, signaling a shift to a bearish trend.

If Ethereum's price continues to struggle, the scenario could unfold where the asset drops further, testing subsequent support levels. While the underlying fundamentals of Ethereum, such as network upgrades and adoption rates, remain robust, the short-term price action could still be subject to corrective forces.

Solana wants another round
The battleground of volatility on the crypto market continues, and Solana (SOL) has not been spared from its whims. Once a darling of the crypto world for its speed and efficiency, SOL has recently been up against a wall, struggling to surpass the crucial $100 mark. The price chart reflects a narrative of struggle and resistance, painting a picture of an asset in need of momentum.
The technical outlook for SOL is looking promising. After a period of bullish activity that piqued the interest of many investors, SOL has hit a snag near the $100 resistance level. This resistance level represents a significant psychological and financial barrier, as it is where sell orders tend to accumulate, putting downward pressure on the price.

Despite efforts to rally, the asset has been unable to generate the necessary momentum to overcome this threshold with ease and currently consolidates at it. One of the key factors influencing this lackluster performance could be the market's tepid reaction to the announcement of Solana phone Saga 2. The news, which might have been expected to inject some enthusiasm onto the market, failed to provide substantial support for Solana's price.

Looking at the chart, the local support levels are clearly delineated. The first line of defense for SOL lies around the $88-$90 price range, where previous dips have found buyers waiting. Should this level fail to hold, the next support may not emerge until it reaches the more robust $70 level, which could act as a stronger foothold for the price.

Conversely, resistance beyond $100 is now more formidable than ever. With each rejection, the resolve of buyers weakens, and the $100 level transforms from a mere price point into a crucial psychological level you should not miss.

"XRP Is Surprisingly Stable, Here's Why","U.Today - XRP is currently holding above the crucial 200-day EMA, a level that has morphed into a dynamic support line. This pivotal line, sitting approximately at $0.55, is now the battleground where XRP's short-term destiny is being contested.

In recent days, XRP's price action has been characterized by its struggle to overcome a series of local resistance levels. A notable rejection was faced around the $0.63 mark, which has added to the narrative of an asset under pressure. Despite these rejections, the asset's ability to stay afloat above the 200-day EMA suggests underlying strength and potential for growth.

XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewThe market's oppressiveness toward XRP can be attributed to various factors, including lack of usecase for XRP and a poor performance throughout the 2023. However, the past has shown that XRP can swiftly shift from oppressed states to strong bullish rallies, often catching many off-guard.

For a scenario where XRP's growth continues, it is essential for the token to maintain its stand above the 200-day EMA. If this level holds, it can serve as a springboard for future bullish attempts. A decisive close above this moving average could stimulate investor confidence, potentially leading to a challenge of the recent resistance at $0.63. A break and hold above this level could signal a trend reversal and may pave the way for XRP to target higher resistances, possibly around the $0.70 to $0.75 regions.

Solana is back in uptrend
Solana is showing signs of entering an uptrend once more. The recent price chart reveals a pattern of resilience, with Solana forming a higher low that indicates a potential shift in market sentiment.
After dipping to a support level around $88 on December 20, 2023, Solana has rebounded, forming a higher low near the $90 mark. This movement suggests accumulating strength and a possible change in direction from the previous downward trend. The local trendline resistance, which Solana is currently testing, is evident at approximately $97.50.

Two pivotal price levels stand out on Solana's chart. The first resistance level after the trendline sits near the $100 psychological mark. This round number has historically been a challenging point for Solana to breach decisively. Beyond that, the $104 level looms as the next significant barrier, which was a previous local high around January 3, 2024.

Conversely, on the support side, the level to watch is around $88, as mentioned earlier. This price has proven to be a firm foundation, with buyers stepping in to uphold Solana's valuation. A secondary support level is present near $85, just below the 50-day moving average, acting as a safety net for any potential retracements.

Ethereum's dominance prevails
Ethereum swiftly cuts through resistance levels with a bullish fervor that has not been seen in recent times. After a spirited 8.8% pump, Ethereum has confidently surpassed the $2,500 and $2,600 milestones, setting its sights firmly on the next major resistance level at $3,000.
The rapid growth witnessed in the past few days has been nothing short of impressive. Ethereum, which lingered around the $2,400 mark in the early days of February, has seen a significant influx of buying pressure, leading to a breakthrough past key resistance levels. This positive price action posits two potential scenarios for the smart contract giant.

In one scenario, Ethereum could continue its aggressive push, riding the wave of current market optimism towards the $3,000 target. If this momentum is maintained, and with the additional fuel from the recent high volume of trades, ETH could test $3,000 in the coming days. A consolidation above $2,600 would be crucial for this scenario to unfold, as it would establish a new support level, reinforcing investor confidence.

Alternatively, given the volatile nature of the crypto markets, a retracement could occur before Ethereum reaches $3,000. This would likely see the asset retesting support at the $2,500 level, which if held, could serve as a springboard for a second wave towards and beyond $3,000.

"Shiba Inu (SHIB) Becoming Bullish, Ethereum (ETH) Price Screams Rally Continuation, Bitcoin (BTC) Not Giving up Market Dominance","U.Today - Shiba Inu currently displays an ascending triangle pattern on the SHIB/USDT chart. This technical formation is widely recognized and could be a signal to a significant price surge for the meme.

An ascending triangle is characterized by a flat upper resistance line and a rising lower support line. This pattern suggests that buyers are gradually gaining ground against sellers, as each dip is bought up at a higher level than the previous one, indicating accumulating pressure for an upward breakout.

SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewFor Shiba Inu, which has been lingering in a period of relatively nonexistent activity, this pattern could serve as massive fuel for volatility in the near future. Recent market conditions have seen a decline in interest toward legacy meme coins, with SHIB being no exception. The lack of significant developments within the Shiba Inu network has contributed to the muted activity around this cryptocurrency.

In contrast, the majority of the action in the meme coin sector has been taking place on the Solana network. This platform has become a hotbed for the deployment of new meme coins, which are exhibiting far greater volatility than those on the Ethereum network, where Shiba Inu resides. The brisk activity on Solana contrasts sharply with the sluggishness observed in Ethereum's meme coin space, drawing in traders and investors looking for quick gains and high excitement.

Ethereum's correction is temporary
The Ethereum market is currently exhibiting a correction, and there are patterns that suggest a rally may not only be on the horizon but could also be in continuation. The asset has recently experienced a sharp downturn, movement that is readily apparent on intraday timeframes. However, such stark movements are often precursors to reversals, signaling that Ethereum could be gearing up for an upswing.
A closer look at the charts shows Ethereum's price action respecting a series of key technical indicators which, together, build a case for potential upward momentum. The asset has been tracing back to touch base with its moving averages, a behavior that is typically followed by a rebound, as these levels can act as dynamic support zones.

This corrective phase is noteworthy, especially considering the robust rally Ethereum enjoyed in the preceding weeks. Corrections are a natural and healthy part of any asset's price trajectory, allowing for consolidation before the next leg up. For Ethereum, the current pullback could be shaking out weak hands, setting the stage for a stronger rally propelled by a more committed investor base.

Bitcoin's dominance not going anywhere
After a brief breach below the 50-day EMA — a critical indicator of medium-term market sentiment — Bitcoin has clawed its way back above this pivotal level. This move indicates a bullish signal for market observers, suggesting that Bitcoin is not yet ready to relinquish its market dominance.
However, the ascent above the 50 EMA has not been met with the kind of vigorous momentum that bulls would hope for. The growth has been moderate, hinting that Bitcoin might encounter selling pressure as it ascends. This is not unusual on the crypto markets, where significant moves often face immediate resistance as traders take profits and skeptics cast doubts.

The recent price action has been a roller coaster for Bitcoin, which saw its value tumble from highs around $47,000 to lows near $41,000. This downturn briefly shifted the spotlight to altcoins, which seized the moment to stage local rallies. The diversification of gains across the crypto spectrum during Bitcoin's periods of weakness is a trend that has become more pronounced as the overall market matures.

Yet Bitcoin's ability to push back above the 50 EMA serves as a reminder of its underlying strength and the confidence investors have placed in it. Despite the opportunity for altcoins to rise, Bitcoin remains the anchor of the crypto market, with its moves often dictating broader market sentiment. This recent rebound above a crucial technical level could be interpreted as Bitcoin's silent assertion that it is not ready to give up the throne just yet.

"Ethereum (ETH) In Dangerous Position, Bitcoin (BTC) About to Lose $40,000, Shiba Inu (SHIB) At Local Support","U.Today - Ethereum finds itself shaky on the edge of a precarious position. The recent price chart indicates a concerning situation: the 26-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a key indicator of short-term momentum, is under threat. If this level fails to hold, Ethereum could see its value dip to the $2,347 mark, a scenario that may well trigger a more pronounced decline.

This potential slip below the 26 EMA is crucial because it suggests a weakening in buying pressure and a shift in market sentiment from accumulation to potential distribution. A break below this level would not only establish $2,347 as the next price floor but could also exacerbate the asset's losses, leading to further bearish momentum.

ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewThe Ethereum ecosystem has faced its share of challenges despite the rise of layer 2-networks, which have not catalyzed the anticipated rally. The broader market has similarly not exhibited the explosive bull run many investors had hoped for, with Ethereum’s trajectory reflecting this subdued market energy.

Additional support and resistance zones can be gleaned from the chart. On the support side, following the $2,347 level, the next critical support lies around $2,175.2 - a breach of which could see ETH test the psychological and technical support near the $2,000 level. Resistance, on the other hand, is firmly established at the recent high of $2,547.6. This price point serves as a litmus test for Ethereum’s ability to rebound and reclaim bullish momentum.

The current market dynamics, marked by cautious trading and a lack of definitive direction, have placed Ethereum in a zone of uncertainty. Investors are advised to monitor these levels closely, as a break below or above these could signal Ethereum's next significant move.

Bitcoin in trouble
Bitcoin finds itself at a precarious juncture as it teeters on the edge of the critical $40,000 mark. The recent price action paints a troubling picture for Bitcoin enthusiasts, with the asset losing its grip on the 50-day Exponential Moving Average, a key support level that has historically indicated bullish sentiment.
As Bitcoin's price struggles to maintain the $40,000 level, the next potential foothold lies at the 100-day EMA. However, this level does not traditionally offer substantial support, and a breach below could precipitate a fall below $39,000, triggering heightened market concern. The chart reveals that the next major support zone stands near the $35,888 mark, a level that buyers might attempt to defend vigorously.

On the resistance front, Bitcoin faces a significant challenge at the $42,786 price level. Overcoming this resistance is crucial for Bitcoin to regain stability and demonstrate potential for a recovery. However, the market currently lacks the necessary liquidity to facilitate a strong rebound, as trading volumes remain relatively low.

Shiba Inu gets hit
The token is currently trading at a local support level, which is a make-or-break situation for its short-term future. A breakdown below this point could spell trouble, signaling a potential decline and testing the resilience of its investor base.
The current market landscape for SHIB is challenging, with a noticeable lack of growth catalysts and low liquidity in the broader cryptocurrency market, both of which could exacerbate the asset's precarious position.

However, there is a glimmer of hope. The descending trading volume accompanying SHIB's price consolidation suggests that bearish momentum could be waning. This deceleration of selling pressure often precedes a stabilization of price, or even a reversal if bulls regain control.

In terms of specific price levels, SHIB is currently finding tentative support around the $0.000027 mark. Should this level fail to hold, the next support zone lies near $0.000022, which may serve as a new accumulation point for buyers. On the resistance side, SHIB faces a hurdle at $0.000035, a breach of which could open the door to a retest of higher levels, possibly around the $0.000040 range.

The recent price chart indicates a concerning situation: the 26-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a key indicator of short-term momentum, is under threat. If this level fails to hold, Ethereum could see its value dip to the $2,347 mark, a scenario that may well trigger a more pronounced decline.

This potential slip below the 26 EMA is crucial because it suggests a weakening in buying pressure and a shift in market sentiment from accumulation to potential distribution. A break below this level would not only establish $2,347 as the next price floor but could also exacerbate the asset's losses, leading to further bearish momentum.

ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewThe Ethereum ecosystem has faced its share of challenges despite the rise of layer 2-networks, which have not catalyzed the anticipated rally. The broader market has similarly not exhibited the explosive bull run many investors had hoped for, with Ethereum’s trajectory reflecting this subdued market energy.

Additional support and resistance zones can be gleaned from the chart. On the support side, following the $2,347 level, the next critical support lies around $2,175.2 - a breach of which could see ETH test the psychological and technical support near the $2,000 level. Resistance, on the other hand, is firmly established at the recent high of $2,547.6. This price point serves as a litmus test for Ethereum’s ability to rebound and reclaim bullish momentum.

The current market dynamics, marked by cautious trading and a lack of definitive direction, have placed Ethereum in a zone of uncertainty. Investors are advised to monitor these levels closely, as a break below or above these could signal Ethereum's next significant move.

Bitcoin in trouble
Bitcoin finds itself at a precarious juncture as it teeters on the edge of the critical $40,000 mark. The recent price action paints a troubling picture for Bitcoin enthusiasts, with the asset losing its grip on the 50-day Exponential Moving Average, a key support level that has historically indicated bullish sentiment.
As Bitcoin's price struggles to maintain the $40,000 level, the next potential foothold lies at the 100-day EMA. However, this level does not traditionally offer substantial support, and a breach below could precipitate a fall below $39,000, triggering heightened market concern. The chart reveals that the next major support zone stands near the $35,888 mark, a level that buyers might attempt to defend vigorously.

On the resistance front, Bitcoin faces a significant challenge at the $42,786 price level. Overcoming this resistance is crucial for Bitcoin to regain stability and demonstrate potential for a recovery.

"Ethereum (ETH) Loses All of Its Gains, Bitcoin (BTC) Not Ready to Give up $40,000, Solana (SOL) Comeback Starts","U.Today - Ethereum has wiped out the gains it had accumulated over a sustained period. The ETH/USD price chart depicts a grim narrative as the digital asset has swiftly descended from its peak, retracing back to levels that question the sustainability of its prior growth.

The steep decline in Ethereum's price is a significant bearish signal. It reflects the market's hesitancy to invest at previous highs, most likely due to the underperformance Ethereum has shown in the recent past. This lack of traction and inability to initiate a recovery underscores the vulnerability of Ethereum's price in the current market climate.

ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewFocusing on the technical aspects, Ethereum has broken through what was once seen as a strong support level at approximately $2,350. This price point, which previously saw substantial buying interest, has now been breached, leading to a cascading effect as the asset searches for new support. The next critical support level is around $2,175, where buyers might emerge to stall the downfall.

Conversely, any attempts at recovery will first encounter resistance at around $2,338, a level that now marks the lower boundary of what was a consolidation range before the drop. A close above this level on significant volume could signal a temporary respite from selling pressure. However, the real test lies at higher resistance levels, previously established around $2,500, where ETH struggled to maintain upward momentum.

Bitcoin ready to fight
Recent candlestick formations portray a scenario where Bitcoin is flirting with a critical resistance level, poised to either confirm a bearish trend or start a substantial recovery.
The chart illustrates Bitcoin’s recent descent, as it lost its foothold at the higher price echelons it previously occupied. However, amid this downward movement, Bitcoin is showing signs of resilience. The latest candles indicate a potential reversal as they hover around a significant support level, which can be identified at approximately $37,000, a region where buyers have historically stepped in.

A sustained hold above this point could catalyze renewed buying interest, which may drive the price toward the immediate resistance level at around $41,000. The significance of reclaiming this threshold cannot be understated, as it may invalidate the bearish outlook and signal a trend reversal.

As for the upper resistances, the $43,000 and $46,000 price levels stand out as notable barriers that Bitcoin would need to breach to cement a robust recovery narrative. Achieving such milestones could sway market sentiment positively, potentially ushering in a wave of optimism among investors.

The moving averages offer additional insight, suggesting a possible bullish crossover should the current momentum persist. This scenario would be further supported by a rise in trading volume, which typically accompanies decisive trend shifts.

Solana among leaders
Solana shows signs of a nascent comeback, presenting a bullish scenario amid a broader market recovery. However, investors tread cautiously, aware of the potential of a ""dead cat bounce"" since volume profiles signal restraint.
Analyzing the SOL/USDT chart, we notice that Solana has established a local support level around the $70 price mark. This is characterized by multiple touches of this level over the past few weeks, each time resisting further downward movement.

On the flip side, the local resistance can be identified near the $96 level, which previously acted as support during Solana's consistent upward trend.

The price movement is currently sandwiched between the 50-day moving average acting as dynamic resistance and the 200-day moving average serving as potential dynamic support. The narrowing gap between these averages could squeeze the price action, possibly leading to a volatility breakout.

"XRP Starts Moving Earlier, Solana (SOL) Already Stronger Than Everyone Else; Does Ethereum (ETH) Need More Fuel?","U.Today - XRP appears to have begun its market movements earlier than anticipated. The chart shows a notable shift from the recent sideways trading pattern, as XRP starts to carve out a new direction.

As of the latest trends, XRP has been testing the support level around $0.50, a crucial psychological threshold for the asset. A sustained move below this level could signal further bearish momentum, potentially leading the price to test the next significant support zone around $0.47.

XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewOn the flip side, if XRP manages to stabilize and bounce back from the current support, the initial resistance is likely to be encountered near the $0.54 mark, where the 50-day moving average currently lies. This moving average has historically acted as a dynamic resistance level, and a breakout above could propel XRP toward the $0.56 level, which aligns with the 100-day moving average.

Further complicating the chart is the downward trendline that has been in play since the local high established in November. This trendline has repeatedly acted as resistance, pushing the price downward each time it has been tested. For a true reversal to be confirmed, XRP would need to break above this trendline with significant volume to validate the move.

Solana is leading pack
Solana is manifesting its strength as the top performer among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Despite overall market volatility, SOL's price action has been signaling a stronger recovery compared to other assets.
At the time of analysis, Solana is trading around the $90 mark, having rebounded with considerable momentum from the support level near $78.35. This pivotal point, bolstered by the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), has served as a springboard for the recent bullish trend. The price of SOL has been consistently creating higher lows, indicative of strong buying interest at these levels.

Resistance for SOL is currently looming at the $100 psychological level, a breakthrough of which could propel the price toward the next significant resistance at $110.

The relative strength of Solana is further substantiated by the resurgence of a risk appetite on the market, particularly evidenced by the blossoming of meme coins. This renewed interest in higher-risk assets typically bodes well for ecosystems like Solana that support a variety of decentralized applications and niche crypto projects.

Ethereum needs push
The Ethereum market is currently facing a confluence of challenges as it searches for the momentum to sustain its position. A recent chart analysis reveals an indecisive atmosphere among investors, with Ethereum struggling to find a strong directional move.
At present, Ethereum is hovering around the $2,200 mark, a level that has seen significant activity and is currently acting as a temporary support. However, the lack of bullish conviction suggests that this support level may not hold if a new wave of selling pressure emerges.

Resistance levels are observed near the $2,400 range, where previous attempts to break higher have been met with a firm rejection, indicating a substantial barrier to upward movement.

The selling pressure is partly attributed to the recent news of Celsius Network liquidating approximately $1 billion worth of Ethereum holdings. This substantial amount has the potential to saturate the market, overwhelming current liquidity and triggering a downturn. As a result, the $2,000 psychological level is eyed as the next critical support zone, a breach of which could see a sharp decline toward the $1,950 region, where the 200-day moving average lies, providing stronger historical support.

On the flip side, if Ethereum can absorb the selling pressure and gain the necessary ""fuel,"" a push above the $2,400 resistance could open the path toward the $2,500 area before challenging the more formidable resistance at $2,600, which aligns with the 50-day moving average.

"Dogecoin (DOGE) Breakout Occurs, What's Next? Solana (SOL) Stays Dominant, Will Ethereum (ETH) Survive Unseen Stalemate?","U.Today - Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency that started as a joke but became a favorite of the masses, including Elon Musk, has recently experienced a significant breakout.

After a period of consolidation, DOGE has broken past a critical resistance level, stirring excitement among traders and investors. The coin is currently sitting above the $0.088 mark, which previously acted as substantial resistance. If DOGE manages to maintain its position above this level, it could solidify this area as new support.

Dogecoin/USDT Chart by TradingViewA break above the $0.095 resistance could signal a continued bullish trend, potentially leading Dogecoin to test the psychological barrier of $0.10. If the momentum is sustained and market sentiment remains positive, DOGE could attempt to reach higher highs, possibly moving toward the $0.105 to $0.11 range last seen during its peak periods of trading activity.

Immediate support for DOGE is now at $0.088 which, if held, could act as a springboard for further climbs. However, should Dogecoin fail to maintain this level, it might fall back to its previous support near $0.078, where buyers have historically shown interest.

A scenario where DOGE's breakout continues would likely involve increased adoption news or a resurgence of interest in meme coins, potentially sparked by social media or celebrity endorsements. Such catalysts could drive demand and push DOGE past the $0.095 level, cementing its breakout status.

Conversely, if the breakout fails to sustain, perhaps due to broader market bearishness or fading interest, DOGE could slide back below $0.088. This would retest the resilience of the $0.078 support. A drop below this level could lead to a bearish phase, with DOGE potentially seeking lower ground.

Solana shows strength
During this market cycle, Solana has established itself as a leader. With its stable and easily scalable performance, it outpaces giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as the majority of DeFi volume went to the ""Ethereum killer.""
As the DeFi ecosystem on Solana flourishes, it is becoming a hub for innovation, blending meme culture with decentralized applications. The network's efficiency and scalability are attracting a wide array of developers.

The cryptocurrency that has been on a strong upward trajectory. Currently, Solana is testing a resistance level at approximately $100, a significant psychological and technical barrier. A convincing break above this level could signal continued bullish momentum, potentially leading to testing the next resistance zone around $108, which coincides with recent highs.

On the downside, the 50-day moving average, sitting near $93.23, is providing dynamic support. This level has been defended multiple times, indicating its importance to traders. If Solana can maintain its footing above this moving average, it would reinforce the asset's stability and could serve as a springboard for further gains.

The next crucial test for Solana will be sustaining above $100. Should it consolidate above this level, it would not be unrealistic to envision a push toward $108, or even higher, as the market reassesses Solana's value proposition in the context of a rapidly evolving DeFi and NFT landscape.

Fundamental Ethereum problems
As it struggles to gain momentum, Ethereum's scalability suffering and the diminishing traction of meme coins on its network are at the forefront of the bearish case for the second-biggest cryptocurrency on the market.
The network's inability to handle high transaction volumes without exorbitant fees has led to the sentiment that Ethereum is becoming ""unusable"" for the day-to-day transactions that meme coins require.

From a technical standpoint, Ethereum's price analysis paints a picture of uncertainty. The asset has been struggling to maintain momentum above crucial support levels. Currently, Ethereum is wavering around the $2,250 mark, with immediate support near the $2,150 level. A break below this support could see a decline toward the $2,000 psychological barrier, which would represent a significant bearish development.

Layer-2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum have emerged as potential stopgaps, offering faster and cheaper transactions. However, their adoption has been less than stellar, with many viewing these platforms as temporary fixes rather than a comprehensive solution to Ethereum's underlying scalability problems.

Ethereum (ETH) Staking Ratio Surprisingly Keeps Surging Despite Shapella,"U.Today - Ki Young Ju, founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, leading on-chain analytical firm, shared his views on the Ethereum (ETH) staking progress. He admits he was wrong about Shapella hard fork's effects.

Ethereum (ETH) staking ratio surges to 24% and counting
Ethereum (ETH) staking ratio, i.e., the percentage of ETH coins locked in staking, reaches 24% and keeps surging. Meanwhile, only 11% of the ETH supply is stored on centralized exchanges. The data was shared by Ki Young Ju on X today, on Jan. 18, 2024.
As such, it is safe to say that the overhyped Ethereum (ETH) upgrade Shapella that allowed stakers to withdraw their coins for the first time since December 2020 did not result in massive unstaking:

Ethereum's (ETH) Shapella was activated in April 2023. As crypto markets were still dominated by bearish sentiment, analysts were expecting withdrawals and consecutive sell-offs of Ethereum (ETH).

The Ethereum (ETH) price also managed to go through this event without significant losses: as stakers withdrew 1 million Ethers (ETH) in first week post-Shapella, the ETH price was fluctuating between $2,000 and $2,100.

Staked Ethereums (ETH) are mostly profitable, Mr. Ki Young Ju adds. While the realized price for staking inflows is $2,014, the current ETH rate is $2,519. As such, the average Ether ""stake"" is being held with a significant 25% profit.

The aggregated volume of the Ethereum (ETH) staking ecosystem is estimated at a whopping $72 billion, with 4.25% in APY, Staking Rewards data says.

Сardano (ADA) staking close to surpassing Solana (SOL)
At the same time, the largest Ethereum (ETH) competitors might be close to a historic ""flippening."" The Solana (SOL) staking ratio is plummeting. The indicator lost over 20% in the last week and dipped below 67%.
Meanwhile, the Cardano (ADA) staking ecosystem added 0.06% in the last seven days and is getting closer to 64%. At the same time, the USD-denominated volume of Solana (SOL) staking is over 200% larger than that of Cardano (ADA).

Out of all mainstream altcoins, Mina Protocol (MINA) demonstrates the largest staking ratio: its stakers locked over 91% of the circulating supply.

Aptos (APT) and Sui (SUI) follow the Mina Protocol (MINA) with 85%-86% in staking ratio.

Staked Ethereums (ETH) are mostly profitable, Mr. Ki Young Ju adds. While the realized price for staking inflows is $2,014, the current ETH rate is $2,519. As such, the average Ether ""stake"" is being held with a significant 25% profit.

The aggregated volume of the Ethereum (ETH) staking ecosystem is estimated at a whopping $72 billion, with 4.25% in APY, Staking Rewards data says.

Сardano (ADA) staking close to surpassing Solana (SOL)
At the same time, the largest Ethereum (ETH) competitors might be close to a historic ""flippening."" The Solana (SOL) staking ratio is plummeting. The indicator lost over 20% in the last week and dipped below 67%.
Meanwhile, the Cardano (ADA) staking ecosystem added 0.06% in the last seven days and is getting closer to 64%. At the same time, the USD-denominated volume of Solana (SOL) staking is over 200% larger than that of Cardano (ADA).

Out of all mainstream altcoins, Mina Protocol (MINA) demonstrates the largest staking ratio: its stakers locked over 91% of the circulating supply.

Aptos (APT) and Sui (SUI) follow the Mina Protocol (MINA) with 85%-86% in staking ratio.

"Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin Makes Surprising Visit to Binance, SHIB Rep Shares Shibarium's Plans to Onboard Thousands of Projects: Crypto News Digest by U.Today","U.Today - Take a look at the most important crypto events with U.Today's top three news stories.

Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin makes surprising visit to Binance
As has been recently shared by Binance CEO Richard Teng on the X platform, Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin made a surprising visit to the Binance office. Teng thanked Buterin for finding time to speak to his team in person, saying that it was a privilege to have him in the company's office. This spontaneous visit caused quite a stir in the crypto community, with many users speculating about a potential collaboration between these two giants of the crypto market. As a reminder, Binance is currently struggling with a $4 billion fine and ongoing regulatory challenges; considering this, Buterin's focus (described in his essay entitled ""Make Ethereum Cypherpunk Again"") on security, privacy and scalability, and concern for centralized exchanges and their vulnerability to hacking, feed rumors about possible cooperation between Buterin and Binance. However, neither Buterin nor Teng made any statements in this regard.
Shibarium: Thousands of projects to join L2 network with numerous partnerships – SHIB rep
In a recent X post, Shiba Inu team member Lucie shared Shibarium's plans for the future. Lucie wrote that the layer-2 solution aims to ""onboard 1,000 projects with numerous partnerships,"" reminding the community that supporting new projects does not necessarily mean canceling existing ones. The SHIB representative then called on all meme token supporters to stay strong as a community during challenging times, stating that there is hardly any point in giving up now if they got ""this far"" in their support for the project's team. Lucie's post has evoked mixed reactions among SHIB army members; even though many of them praised the SHIB developers, some users questioned the project team's ability to accomplish anything more than just making plans and promising new advances.
JPMorgan: Bitcoin ETF hype cooling
According to Kenneth Worthington, analyst at JPMorgan, the initial enthusiasm surrounding Bitcoin ETFs may be waning, with a shift toward a ""more normalized flow environment"" being potentially on the horizon. On Jan. 26, spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced net sales of about $15 million following a four-day streak of redemptions. This reversal could be an indication of changing investor sentiment on these novel financial products. Since their launch, the Bitcoin price has plunged by about 9% but has since stabilized around $42,000 as the new trading week gets underway. Previously, JPMorgan correctly predicted that the approval of Bitcoin ETFs would be a sell-the-news event. Before the approval, the price of the leading cryptocurrency dropped from above $47,000 to below $39,000. The sell-off coincided with large outflows from Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which transitioned into a spot Bitcoin ETF after the SEC's approval.

"Ethereum (ETH) Bullish Momentum to Begin at These Crucial Levels, Says Top Analyst","U.Today - In the ever-evolving landscape of the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum (ETH) has found itself under the scrutiny of analysts as the digital asset hovers around crucial price levels. A prominent figure in the crypto space known as Crypto Tony on X (formerly Twitter) recently shared insights, asserting that Ethereum's bullish momentum could be initiated if it maintains a position above $2,130, with even greater optimism should it reclaim the range high at $2,500.

As of the latest market data, Ethereum is currently priced at $2,262, reflecting a modest 1.22% increase over the past 24 hours. However, the cryptocurrency has experienced a 4.29% decrease over the last 30 days, showcasing the volatility inherent in the market. The trading volume for ETH has notably surged by 75.24% in the last 24 hours, reaching $9,626,210,522, indicating heightened activity and interest in the digital asset.

Crypto Tony's emphasis on the $2,130 and $2,500 thresholds aligns with the sentiment of many Ethereum enthusiasts, who closely monitor these levels as potential catalysts for a sustained bullish trend. The cryptocurrency community eagerly waits to see if Ethereum can not only maintain but surpass these critical levels in the coming days.

Potential bullish catalyst
In a related development, the Ethereum network is on the verge of a major upgrade, known as the Prague upgrade or Pectra upgrade. This imminent update has generated considerable buzz within the Ethereum community, as it promises substantial enhancements and alterations to the platform. The Prague upgrade is anticipated to introduce improvements in scalability, security and overall functionality, which could positively impact Ethereum's price trajectory.
The potential bullish effect of the Prague upgrade on ETH's value has sparked discussions among investors and analysts, with some speculating that the impending changes could serve as a catalyst for a price surge, propelling Ethereum above current levels.

While the market remains dynamic and unpredictable, the confluence of technical analysis highlighting key price levels and the anticipation of a major network upgrade contributes to the growing intrigue surrounding Ethereum's future price movements. Market participants are closely monitoring the developments, ready to capitalize on potential opportunities as ETH navigates these crucial junctures in the ever-evolving crypto landscape.

Will This Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Pattern Start Reversal?,"U.Today - Shiba Inu is currently showcasing a price pattern that could potentially lead to a reversal. The pattern, characterized by SHIB breaking below the 200-day Exponential Moving Average, might be indicating an opportune moment for investors and traders to consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) into their positions.

The 200-day EMA is a critical long-term indicator that many investors watch to determine market trends. A break below this line can often suggest bearish sentiment. However, for the astute investor, this can also present an attractive entry point, especially for those looking to DCA or accumulating during dips in anticipation of future gains.

Despite the current breach, SHIB's approach to this level has historically been met with a strong reaction from buyers, sometimes resulting in a notable price reversal. If the pattern holds true to its historical behavior, the price of SHIB may soon find sufficient support to halt the decline and initiate an upward trajectory.

Nonetheless, it is crucial to acknowledge that SHIB has been facing consistent selling pressure, evident every time there is an attempt to push the price higher. This consistent sell-off following attempts to rise has created a challenging environment for SHIB to sustain any substantial gains.

The current market scenario for SHIB is a delicate balancing act between bearish pressure and the potential for a bullish reversal. For new investors looking to enter the market, the area just below the 200 EMA could prove to be a significant level, provided they are comfortable with the inherent risks involved with such volatile assets. Older investors can use the price level to dollar cost average their holdings.

Solana loses steam
Solana (SOL), the blockchain platform known for its speed and efficiency, has recently experienced a significant breakdown, signaling a pause in the bullish momentum that had characterized its market behavior. After a prolonged uptrend, the correction has aggravated into a more pronounced price fall, indicating a shift in market sentiment.
The chart reveals that Solana has decisively exited its previous uptrend, characterized by higher highs and higher lows, and has entered a correction phase. The volume profile during this downturn suggests that the selling pressure has intensified, leading to a breakdown below critical support levels. This pattern is often a precursor to further declines as market confidence wanes.

For those looking for a scenario in which Solana could rebound, a relief rally could emerge from oversold conditions, indicated by RSI approaching lower bounds. Such a rally would require a catalyst, possibly in the form of positive developments within the Solana ecosystem or broader crypto market sentiment shifts. A rebound scenario might also be supported by traders looking for value buys at lower price points, thus creating sufficient buying pressure to counter the recent downtrend.

Ethereum meets substantial support
Ethereum has recently encountered a significant level of support, touching the 50-day Exponential Moving Average, a critical indicator for determining local trends.
The 50-day EMA has historically been a stronghold for Ethereum's price, acting as a pivot point between the bullish and bearish territories. After a period of decline, Ethereum's approach to this level suggests that we may be on the cusp of a reversal. This is particularly compelling given Ethereum's past performance, where touches of the 50 EMA have often led to a resurgence in buying activity, driving the price upward.

Currently, the intersection with the 50 EMA aligns with a descending trading volume, indicating a potential decrease in selling pressure. This trend could signify market consolidation before a bullish reversal, as lower volume alongside support touchpoints often precedes a shift in momentum.

The implications of this volume decrease are twofold. First, it may suggest that the recent sell-off is losing steam, and the market is running out of sellers at current price levels. Second, it may imply that the market is awaiting further catalysts or developments within the Ethereum ecosystem, such as updates on Ethereum 2.0 or broader crypto market trends, before initiating the next significant move.

Ethereum (ETH) at Critical Juncture as Michaël van de Poppe Predicts Bullish Breakout,"U.Today - In the ever-evolving landscape of the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum (ETH) finds itself at a critical juncture, with renowned crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe predicting a potential bullish breakout. In a recent tweet, van de Poppe conveyed his insights, indicating that Ethereum was approaching the low of 2022 and was likely to absorb liquidity at that level.

He expressed the belief that in the event of a spot ETF approval for Bitcoin (BTC), there would potentially be a liquidation candle on the trading chart for the ETH/BTC trading pair. Following this, analyst van de Poppe foresaw a rotation of funds into Ethereum, accompanied by a bullish weekly divergence.

According to the most recent data, Ethereum is presently valued at $2,294, indicating a noteworthy 3.04% uptick in the past 24 hours. The trading volume within this period has experienced a substantial surge, escalating by 36.14% and peaking at $12.48 billion. In the aftermath of this modest rally, ETH has observed $21.60 million in short liquidations and $11.79 million in long liquidations, as reported by CoinGlass.

Spillover effect
The focal point of van de Poppe's analysis revolves around the potential approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The cryptocurrency market anticipates a breakthrough, with BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), a financial behemoth, leading the charge. BlackRock, along with other prominent firms such as Grayscale Investments, Valkyrie and ARK 21Shares, has recently submitted updated 19b-4 filings for their proposed spot Bitcoin ETFs.
Market sentiment is building as BlackRock expresses confidence in the SEC's approval for its spot Bitcoin ETF, with expectations pointing toward a potential decision as early as this Wednesday. A positive outcome could trigger a ripple effect in the broader cryptocurrency market, impacting not only Bitcoin but also potentially leading to a rotation of funds into Ethereum.

Michaël Van de Poppe's prediction hinges on the notion that Bitcoin spot ETF approval may prompt a notable uptrend for Ethereum. Traders and investors are closely monitoring these developments, recognizing the interconnected nature of cryptocurrencies and the potential spillover effects of major regulatory decisions. As Ethereum stands at this critical juncture, the market awaits further clarity from regulatory bodies and key players in the cryptocurrency space.

"Samson Mow Issues Ultra-Bullish Bitcoin Statement, Dogecoin Whale Moves 332.9 Million DOGE to Binance, Michaël van de Poppe Predicts Bullish Breakout for ETH: Crypto News Digest by U.Today","U.Today - U.Today has prepared a summary of the top three news stories over the past day.

Ultra-bullish Bitcoin statement made by Samson Mow ahead of possible ETF approval
As the crypto community is eagerly awaiting the SEC's decision regarding the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, Bitcoin maximalist Samson Mow took to X platform to share his mega-bullish expectations on BTC's price movement. According to Mow, Bitcoin reaching $1 million may happen any day from now, and this sudden price surge will be “max pain” for most market participants. He explained that many companies, including his own, Jan3, have many plans and meetings scheduled for the year 2024, and should Bitcoin spike to $1 million, it would “derail everything.” Apart from Jan3, Mow named other big figures in the crypto space who would see their plans collapse in the event that BTC suddenly reached $1 million: analyst Plan B and his stock-to-flow model for Bitcoin, MicroStrategy with its goal to accumulate 1% of the Bitcoin supply and El Salvador, as it would not be able to issue Bitcoin bonds and buy more BTC below the $100,000 level.
Dogecoin (DOGE) whale transfers 332.9 million DOGE to Binance
According to data provided by Whale Alert's X account, yesterday, a Dogecoin (DOGE) whale moved a large amount of dog-themed tokens to Binance.

It remains unclear what motivated the whale to make such a significant transfer, and Dogecoin enthusiasts are speculating about its potential implications for the broader DOGE ecosystem. Meanwhile, DOGE has seen a decline in its value, going down by 21.98% over the past 30 days. The Dogecoin community is looking forward to further developments, both in terms of the whale's activities and the impact of the recent lunar launch on DOGE's market dynamics.

"Ethereum (ETH) Jumps 11.4%, Here's How Whales Are Changing Game","U.Today - There is ongoing mega accumulation of Ethereum (ETH) by whales within the crypto ecosystem. According to data from the crypto analytics platform Lookonchain, a whale with the wallet address ""0xAA15"" withdrew a total of 5,762 ETH worth approximately $15.06 million from Binance earlier today. Overall, this whale has bought a total of 50,733 ETH $99.2 million at an average price of $1,955 since Sept. 19, 2023.

At the time of writing, Ethereum has jumped by 11.42% in the past 24 hours to $2,645.07. The cryptocurrency has grown from a 24-hour low of $2,353.93 to its price at the moment, driven in part by the hype ravaging the market following the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
This approval is boosting sentiment that the spot Ethereum ETF might also be on the way. This has further pushed retail sentiment as well, with Ethereum now notably eyeing the $2,700 benchmark.

Ethereum (ETH) Shows Who's King of Alts,"U.Today - Ethereum continues to assert its dominance, proving to investors and enthusiasts why it reigns supreme among altcoins. The recent price action of Ethereum paints a bullish narrative, with potential signals pointing toward an ongoing growth cycle that could redefine its market stature.

Ethereum's market movement has been extremely dominant following the approval of the Bitcoin ETF, with the asset recently piercing through significant resistance levels. After a sustained period above the 50-day and 100-day EMAs, ETH has shown formidable strength.

Currently, Ethereum's price hovers around $2,600, with the immediate resistance level now likely forming near the $2,700 mark, a point at which sellers previously stepped in. A decisive break above this level could open the gates for further escalation toward the $3,000 psychological barrier.

ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewOn the flip side, local support can be identified at around the $2,500 level, where a confluence of the EMAs and historical price reactions provides a safety net against potential pullbacks. Should Ethereum retreat from its current levels, the $2,400 and $2,300 levels stand ready to act as secondary and tertiary support zones, where buying interest has coalesced in the past.

The backdrop to this vigorous market movement is the speculation regarding the potential approval of an Ethereum ETF. The recent green light for a Bitcoin spot ETF has amplified discussions around its Ethereum counterpart. Such approval would be a significant catalyst for Ethereum, potentially drawing in a new wave of institutional and retail investment.

The primary strength of a spot Ethereum ETF lies in its direct exposure to the actual asset, rather than the derivatives market that futures-based ETFs represent. This means that an ETF would purchase actual Ethereum, providing direct support to its price and reflecting true market sentiment more accurately. Moreover, it would offer investors a way to gain exposure to Ethereum without the complexities of managing cryptocurrency wallets and keys, thereby simplifying entry onto the crypto market.

The approval of an Ethereum ETF would not only validate the asset's maturity and market significance but also solidify its position as a mainstay in the portfolios of diverse investors. Given Ethereum's foundational role in the development of DeFi and NFTs, an ETF would be a testament to its integral place in the digital economy.

Despite the approval of one of the most long-awaited financial products for the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin displayed a stoic reaction, subverting the expectations of many investors, who were bracing for a significant market upheaval. The cryptocurrency's price stability post-ETF news, while surprising to some, has been a more favorable outcome compared to the sell-off that many had predicted.
The relative calmness in Bitcoin's price has provided a conducive backdrop for altcoins to shine. Ethereum (ETH) notably breached the $2,500 mark, and Solana (SOL) regained a $100 valuation, underscoring a night of triumph for alternative cryptocurrencies. This decoupling of Bitcoin's movement from altcoin performance is a phenomenon that has been increasingly observed, suggesting a maturing market where assets can thrive on individual merit and ecosystem developments.

The chart at hand paints a picture of consolidation for Bitcoin, with the price hovering around the $45,000 region. The lack of a significant corrective move post-ETF news has lent a supportive floor to the broader crypto market. Trading volumes, alongside price action, indicate a steady holding pattern, a sign that the market is digesting the recent developments without panic or overenthusiasm.

Despite the current stability, the market should not discount the potential for an uptick in Bitcoin’s value. Historically, actual capital inflow following such regulatory milestones has been a precursor to upward movements in the cryptocurrency's price. If history is to serve as a reference, the approval of a Bitcoin ETF may yet act as a delayed fuse, igniting a rally as new capital finds its way onto the market.

Investors are advised to maintain cautious optimism. While current market conditions have not triggered the volatility many feared, the introduction of ETFs is a substantial change to the investment landscape of Bitcoin. As traditional investors and institutions increasingly engage with Bitcoin through these new financial products, the potential for a significant impact on the cryptocurrency’s value trajectory is tangible.

"Here's Who Burned 9,001 ETH in Last 30 Days","U.Today - Uniswap, the world’s largest decentralized exchange, is apparently a top burner of Ethereum, with a staggering 9,001 ETH incinerated from the circulating supply in the last 30 days. This activity firmly positions Uniswap as a key player in the Ethereum ecosystem, not just in terms of volume but also in influencing the coin's scarcity.

The mechanism behind Ethereum's burn is a recent upgrade known as EIP-1559, which introduced a transaction fee burn for every operation made on the network. Uniswap, as the leading DEX, handles a massive volume of transactions, naturally leading to a higher rate of ETH being burned. This burn acts as a deflationary force on the supply of Ethereum, theoretically creating scarcity that could bolster the asset's value over the long term.

ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewHowever, the correlation between burn rate and immediate price action is not linear. While Uniswap's significant contribution to the burn rate underscores its dominance, the short-term impact on Ethereum’s price is subdued. Over a longer horizon, this deflationary mechanism is expected to establish a supportive base for the price of ETH, as reducing supply, ceteris paribus, should increase the value of each remaining ETH.

It is important to note, though, that scarcity alone does not guarantee value growth. The intrinsic value of Ethereum also hinges on its utility, adoption and broader market sentiment. Currently, Ethereum is facing stiff competition from Solana in ecosystem growth, with many traders who favor volatility and risk gravitating toward Solana.

A technical analysis of Ethereum's current price action shows a challenging market phase. Ethereum is attempting to hold support around the $2,400 level. Should it fail to sustain this, the next key support is observed at the $2,300 mark, near the 50-day EMA. A breach below this could see Ethereum test the $2,000 psychological support level. Conversely, if Ethereum can rally past the immediate resistance at $2,500, it could pave the way to retest previous highs near $2,800.

Bitcoin and Ethereum Bulls Taking Control: $60 Million of Shorts Liquidated Ahead of Weekend,"U.Today - The cryptocurrency market is witnessing a strong bullish momentum as Bitcoin and Ethereum bulls start to assert control. In a significant development, shorts worth approximately $60 million have been liquidated, signaling a potential shift in market sentiment as we approach the weekend.

Analyzing the current charts, Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience, managing to sustain above the crucial support level of $40,000. The coin has recently experienced a rebound from this level, which has historically acted as a strong psychological barrier for both bulls and bears.

Source: CoinglassIf BTC maintains its position above this support, the next key resistance to watch will be around $42,000, a level where we might expect some consolidation before a further push. On the downside, if the $40,000 level fails to hold, traders should look for potential support near the $38,500 region.

Ethereum, on the other hand, is also showing signs of recovery after a recent sell-off. The coin has found support near the $2,100 mark, just above the 200-day exponential moving average, which is often considered a significant indicator of long-term trends.

If ETH can sustain this rebound, the immediate resistance is expected at $2,400. A breakthrough above this could open the path toward $2,500, a level that previously acted as both support and resistance. A fall below the current support level could see the price testing the next support zone around $2,000.

The liquidation heatmap provides additional context, illustrating the pressure on short sellers as the market moves against their positions. This liquidation is particularly evident in the case of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have seen a significant number of short positions being closed in a short span of time. Overall, the market is currently displaying bullish signs, with strong support levels holding up.

"Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin Makes Surprising Visit to Binance, New CEO Richard Teng Shares","U.Today - In an unexpected turn of events, Ethereum (ETH) cofounder and prominent figure in the cryptocurrency industry, Vitalik Buterin, paid a surprise visit to the Binance office. The revelation came from the CEO of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, Richard Teng, who shared the news on his X page.

Teng expressed his gratitude for the privilege of hosting Buterin.

The impromptu meeting sparked a flurry of speculation within the crypto community, as enthusiasts and experts alike pondered the potential collaboration between these two giants of the crypto market. Notably, Binance has been grappling with heightened regulatory scrutiny in recent months, leading to the legal predicament of its former CEO, Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao.

Vitalik and Binance connections
This unexpected rendezvous holds significance, given Buterin and Binance's history of active collaboration, such as Buterin's contribution to the proof-of-reserves concept for centralized crypto exchanges just two years ago. Against the backdrop of Binance's $4 billion fine and ongoing regulatory challenges, the nature of the discussions between Buterin and the Binance team remains shrouded in mystery.
Vitalik Buterin's recent focus, as evident in his essay titled ""Make Ethereum Cypherpunk Again,"" centers on security, privacy and scalability. Notably, he addressed concerns about centralized exchanges and their vulnerability to hacking — a topic that adds fuel to the speculation of potential collaborative efforts between Buterin and Binance.

As the crypto community eagerly awaits further developments, the surprise visit has sparked intense discussions about the future direction of these industry heavyweights.

Ethereum (ETH) Needs These 3 Crucial Factors to Align for Growth: Details,"U.Today - Despite Ethereum's position as a frontrunner in the altcoin sector, its growth has been stunted by a bearish trend that has held a tight grip on the market in recent weeks. A closer look at the ETH chart reveals that the expected volatility spike that could catalyze a bullish reversal has yet to materialize.

Layer-2 network adoption and ecosystem expansion
First, the surge of layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism could be a catalyst for Ethereum's growth. These networks aim to enhance Ethereum's ecosystem by providing the much-needed scalability and reduced fees, potentially driving renewed interest and increased adoption of the Ethereum network.
ETH/USD Chart by TradingView

Scalability and network efficiency
Second, Ethereum's persistent scalability issues must be addressed. Despite the implementation of EIP-1559, which was anticipated to make transaction fees more predictable, the network still struggles under high demand, leading to exorbitant fees and reduced network functionality. Resolving these scalability woes is crucial, as a more efficient and cost-effective network is vital for Ethereum to retain its value and utility.
Introduction of Ethereum ETF
Finally, the establishment of an Ethereum ETF would be a strong bullish signal, mirroring the impact of the Bitcoin ETF. An Ethereum ETF would pave the way for institutional investment, providing a regulated and accessible means for traditional investors to gain exposure to ETH. This could secure Ethereum's future as a mainstream financial asset and provide a stable foundation for long-term growth.
Looking at the Ethereum chart, we identify a local resistance level at approximately $2433.5, a price point that has acted as a hurdle in recent trading sessions. For a bullish case to solidify, Ethereum needs to break past this resistance with conviction. Should this occur, it could signal a shift in investor sentiment and open the path to higher price levels.

Self-Proclaimed Satoshi Craig Wright Takes Dig at Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin,"U.Today - In an unexpected turn of events today, self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto Craig Wright took a swipe at Ethereum's creator, Vitalik Buterin. Wright revisited a series of posts by Buterin in 2017, where he discussed the early versions of the Ethereum protocol.

Back then, Buterin had responded to a question about the possibility of building Ethereum on top of Bitcoin, expressing concerns about potential conflicts with Bitcoin's development team. He cited fears that protocol rules might change, making it difficult for him to build on a base protocol at odds with his vision.

Fast forward to January 2024, and Wright seized the opportunity to comment on Buterin's past remarks. He argued that Ethereum only exists due to centralized development teams that have the power to alter the protocol. Wright mused about the hypothetical scenario of having everything built on Bitcoin, envisioning a more streamlined and less fragmented system.

Bitcoin v. Ethereum
Wright's comments add fuel to the longstanding rivalry between Bitcoin and Ethereum, highlighting fundamental differences in their approaches to decentralization and protocol governance.
While Ethereum has achieved considerable success as a platform for smart contracts and applications, Wright argues for the stability and originality of Bitcoin's protocol.

Moreover, it revives the centralization debate in both cryptocurrency ecosystems. On the one side is OFAC's censorship of ETH transactions; on the other side is the enormous concentration of BTC in the hands of whales and miners.

"Samson Mow Takes Subtle Jab at Ethereum (ETH), Is XRP Next?","U.Today - Samson Mow, the chief executive officer of investment firm Jan3 and prominent Bitcoin (BTC) bull and evangelist, has taken his advocacy for the top coin to a new level. In his latest post on X, he took a subtle jab at alternative investment assets, including Silver and Ethereum (ETH), as his way of reducing their viability in comparison to their counterparts Gold and Silver.

Samson Mow analogy
According to Samson Mow, Silver is the poor man’s Gold, a statement that shows that investors who consider the latter to be too expensive typically opt in for the former. While both are respected metals and investment assets, Gold is still considered the superior of the two.
Samson Mow deflated Ethereum’s ego to end the long-standing superiority debate with Bitcoin. The vocal investor noted that ""Ethereum is the stupid man's Bitcoin,"" a statement that spooked members of the ETH community.

By valuation, Bitcoin’s market cap currently stands at $809,923,408,001, while that of Ethereum comes in at $297,575,053,741. The price differentials of $41,344.01 to $2,476.66 also show that Bitcoin is the most valuable of the two. Over time, there have been conversations about shifting capital from BTC to ETH, a trend that might be amplified in the coming months if Ethereum’s key fundamentals come into play.

The harsh criticism of Ethereum did not go down well with its community members, with some pointing out the key improvements the protocol has made as a blockchain in itself.

Is XRP next?
As a Bitcoin Maxi, Samson Mow was asked by one of the commenters on his post what he thinks about XRP if Ethereum is the poor man’s Bitcoin. He simply answered that the demand is a ""tricky one.""
Samson Mow’s confidence in Bitcoin has made him forecast a $1 million price target, and his lack of confidence in XRP and Ethereum has undoubtedly made his bearish stand subtle.

U.Today - Samson Mow, the chief executive officer of investment firm Jan3 and prominent Bitcoin (BTC) bull and evangelist, has taken his advocacy for the top coin to a new level. In his latest post on X, he took a subtle jab at alternative investment assets, including Silver and Ethereum (ETH), as his way of reducing their viability in comparison to their counterparts Gold and Silver.

Samson Mow analogy
According to Samson Mow, Silver is the poor man’s Gold, a statement that shows that investors who consider the latter to be too expensive typically opt in for the former. While both are respected metals and investment assets, Gold is still considered the superior of the two.
Samson Mow deflated Ethereum’s ego to end the long-standing superiority debate with Bitcoin. The vocal investor noted that ""Ethereum is the stupid man's Bitcoin,"" a statement that spooked members of the ETH community.

By valuation, Bitcoin’s market cap currently stands at $809,923,408,001, while that of Ethereum comes in at $297,575,053,741. The price differentials of $41,344.01 to $2,476.66 also show that Bitcoin is the most valuable of the two. Over time, there have been conversations about shifting capital from BTC to ETH, a trend that might be amplified in the coming months if Ethereum’s key fundamentals come into play.

The harsh criticism of Ethereum did not go down well with its community members, with some pointing out the key improvements the protocol has made as a blockchain in itself.

Ethereum (ETH) Faces Serious Bug; Here's Who Might Be Affected,"U.Today - Ethereum is potentially facing a significant bug that has emerged, previously only assumed as a hypothetical scenario in discussions among the developer and validator community back in March 2022, but now it looms as a potential threat that could become a reality.

This bug concerns the Ethereum staking mechanism and how the network reaches consensus. In essence, if a majority client, holding more than 2/3 of the stake, has a bug, it could inadvertently build an invalid chain that the network would consider finalized due to the majority stake's ""agreement.""

If validators running this buggy client commit to this incorrect chain, any attempt to switch to a correct chain could result in severe penalties due to how the Ethereum protocol is designed to penalize what it sees as ""equivocating"" validators.

What makes this situation particularly alarming is the scale of the potential impact. If this bug manifests, the validators could find themselves in a predicament where they either continue to support an incorrect chain or switch to a correct one at great personal cost. The validators running the buggy client would face a dilemma: lose their stake through penalties or persist with an invalid chain, endangering the network's integrity.

For the average Ethereum holder not involved in staking or blockchain development, this might seem distant, but the implications can be far-reaching. An individual commented that the situation is ""pretty scary,"" and it is also the main reason why they do not stake any ETH. This sentiment reflects a potentially surging concern among holders who fear the ripple effects a bug of this magnitude could have on the network's trust and stability.

Centralized exchanges (CEXes), although well capitalized, might also feel the effect of potential finalization issues. Though their liquidity is far more resilient, mitigating large losses might still become an issue.

"Ethereum Whale Moves $46 Million in ETH Across Binance, Bitfinex and Aave: Details","U.Today - In a surprising move that has captured the attention of the cryptocurrency community, an Ethereum (ETH) whale has orchestrated a series of transactions involving major exchanges, moving a staggering $46.02 million in ETH over the past two days. The entity, utilizing a network of eight wallets, withdrew funds from Binance and Bitfinex before staking with Lido, a liquid staking solution.

Blockchain analytics platform Spot On Chain first brought attention to the substantial transactions through a tweet, revealing intricate details of the massive ETH movement. The whale withdrew the Ethereum holdings from crypto exchanges Binance and Bitfinex at an average price of approximately $2,419.

Subsequently, five wallets were employed to withdraw 50.15 million USDT from Aave, a prominent DeFi protocol, to the CEX trading platform, exchanging the stablecoin for 19,021 ETH, equivalent to the $46.02 million value. Spot On Chain further disclosed that three wallets still retained around 30 million USDT in Aave, sparking speculation that they might deposit these funds into a CEX soon, potentially acquiring more ETH.

Ethereum price struggles
The timing of these transactions coincided with a challenging period for the Ethereum market. At the time of the whale's activity, the price of ETH struggled, recording a 4.57% dip in the last 24 hours and a 9.46% decline in the past week. Current market data indicates ETH trading at $2,296.
Coinglass, another analytics platform, reported a significant amount of liquidations for ETH within the last 24 hours, totaling $53.78 million. Of this amount, $47.48 million resulted from long liquidations, while short liquidations accounted for $6.29 million. The liquidation data underscores the volatility and uncertainty prevalent on the market, with traders experiencing significant losses.

Market analysts and enthusiasts are closely monitoring these developments, as such large-scale transactions from influential entities often lead to speculation and conjecture regarding potential market impacts. Traders and investors are advised to exercise caution and stay vigilant as the cryptocurrency landscape continues to unfold, revealing the dynamics of this rapidly evolving market.

Ethereum (ETH) Becomes Target of Massive $1 Billion Sell-Off: Who's Responsible?,"U.Today - Ethereum is encountering a massive sell-off exceeding $1 billion. The source of this enormous market movement can be traced back to Celsius, which reportedly transferred a staggering 459,561 ETH, valued at approximately $1.014 billion, to various exchanges.

The distribution of this sell-off was as follows: 297,454 ETH ($656.5 million) moved to Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) Prime, 146,507 ETH to Paxos Treasury and smaller amounts of 7,800 ETH each, totaling $17.2 million, were transferred to FalconX and Coinbase. Despite this massive transfer, Celsius reportedly retains a reserve of 62,468 ETH, worth around $139 million.

Such a colossal sale exerts immense pressure on Ethereum's price and could significantly sway market sentiment. The immediate concern for investors and traders is whether Ethereum's liquidity and market capitalization can absorb such a hit without triggering a broad market downturn.

From a technical analysis standpoint, the massive outflow from Celsius is a bearish signal, likely to test Ethereum's local support levels. A crucial support to watch is around the $2,000 price range, a psychological and technical support level, which, if breached, could see the price tumble to the next significant support at $1,800. This level has historically acted as a strong buy zone and may serve as a robust defense against further declines.

Conversely, resistance levels have become more formidable due to the sell-off. Any potential recovery will have to confront the resistance at $2,200, which previously acted as a support level. A break above this could see Ethereum attempt to reclaim higher price levels, possibly testing the $2,400 resistance.

The substantial sell-off initiated by Celsius has placed Ethereum in a problematic position. Although the Ethereum network's fundamentals remain robust, the asset's price resilience in the face of such a significant sell-off shows the actual state of the market.

Major FED Decision to Affect Crypto Market in Two Days,"U.Today - The crypto market is bracing itself as the Federal Reserve gears up to announce its first interest rate decision of 2024. The whispers from the CME about a 96.9% chance to keep interest rates unchanged are causing ripples. Yet, with the second decision in March casting a 47% shadow of a rate cut by 25 basis points (bps), investors are on edge. Adding to the economic fervor, the United States is set to release the January unemployment rate, which could further sway market sentiment.

The Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates is a critical economic lever that traditionally influences traditional markets and, as has been seen, the cryptocurrency market as well. An unchanged interest rate could maintain the status quo, possibly keeping investment steady in assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

A cut, however, could signal economic caution, potentially reducing the attractiveness of risk assets like cryptocurrencies or, conversely, could lead investors to seek higher returns in the crypto market if traditional investments falter.

BTC/USD Chart by TradingViewAnalyzing the Bitcoin chart, there is a distinctive ""war"" between the bulls and bears. The immediate resistance level to watch is around the $42,500 mark, which Bitcoin has been testing recently. This level is crucial because a decisive close above it could signal increasing bullish momentum. On the downside, the support level at approximately $39,528, aligning with a psychological round number and a previous area of interest, is one that traders are likely to defend vigorously.

The upcoming Fed decision could serve as a catalyst for Bitcoin's next big move. If interest rates remain unchanged, Bitcoin could continue to test the resistance level, and a break above could confirm a bullish reversal. However, should rates decrease, Bitcoin's reaction might be even more unpredictable.

"Shiba Inu (SHIB) Rapidly Breaks Down, Ethereum (ETH) Loses Traction, While Solana (SOL) Presents Hidden Opportunity","U.Today - Shiba Inu has experienced a significant breakdown from its recent consolidation phase. The chart depicts a clear downward trajectory as SHIB failed to maintain its position within the ascending triangle pattern it had formed over the past few months.

The breakdown was signaled as SHIB prices breached the key support level at $0.000009, which had previously acted as a reliable floor for the price during consolidation phases. Following this, SHIB prices tumbled further, slicing through subsequent support near $0.0000087. This price action marked a decisive shift in market sentiment from accumulation to distribution.

SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewThe next support level to watch is at $0.0000082, where SHIB may find a temporary reprieve from the selling pressure. If this level fails to hold, the next critical support lies at $0.0000076, which could serve as the last line of defense before a more significant drop.

For a reversal to occur and for SHIB to regain its upward momentum, it would need to reclaim previous support levels and transform them back into supports. This would require a substantial influx of buying pressure, potentially sparked by positive developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem or broader cryptocurrency market rallies.

The first sign of a possible reversal would be a return above $0.0000087, followed by a sustained move above the $0.000009 price level. A breakout above these levels, accompanied by increasing volume, could indicate that the downtrend is losing steam and that bulls are regaining control.

Solana paints reversal pattern
Solana has been developing a subtle yet potentially pivotal chart pattern. The asset has been tracing a slow and steady ascending channel, a formation that suggests a controlled and consistent uptrend. This pattern, characterized by higher lows and higher highs contained within two parallel trendlines, speaks to potential for continued growth.
The significance of this pattern lies in the momentum it could provide for SOL. Should the price action remain strong within the upper half of the channel, and particularly if it challenges the upper trendline, we could see Solana break through and embark on a more aggressive rally.

Such a bullish scenario would likely be supported by increased trading volume and positive developments within the Solana ecosystem, such as new project launches or updates that enhance network performance.

The immediate local resistance stands at around $55, and a confident push beyond this could confirm bullish sentiment. Inversely, if Solana's price dips below the channel's lower boundary, around $48, it could indicate that a bearish narrative is taking hold.

Ethereum momentum decreasing
Ethereum is exhibiting signs of waning momentum, as observed in recent price movements. The asset, which has long been considered the backbone of the decentralized finance sector, is facing a pivotal moment that could determine its trajectory for the coming weeks.
The provided chart illustrates Ethereum's struggle to maintain its grasp on the market. The price has been on a downward trend, edging closer to the local 26-day Exponential Moving Average. This level, currently near $2,465, is critical; if Ethereum fails to hold this line, we might see it descend to test the more significant 50 EMA, which stands around the $2,300 mark.

The 26 EMA serves as a short-term sentiment gauge, and its breach could signal a lack of immediate bullish support. Should this level fail to act as a springboard for price recovery, Ethereum's next stop could indeed be the 50 EMA. A breach below this longer-term moving average could potentially open the gates for a test of lower support levels, highlighting the need for investors to brace for more volatility.

Market participants are now recalibrating their expectations, understanding that the road to sustainable gains is a long-term journey.

"XRP's Epic Battle Against Bears, Solana Breaks $100, While Ethereum Fights for Momentum","U.Today - XRP is currently locked in a fierce struggle with bearish forces. The digital asset, which operates within the Ripple network, is experiencing difficulty establishing a position above a critical technical indicator — the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).

The 200 EMA serves as an important barometer for the long-term trend and investor sentiment. For XRP, remaining below this level suggests that the asset lacks the bullish momentum needed to shift into an upward trajectory. This inability to secure a foothold above the 200 EMA raises questions about the stability of positive price action in the near term.

XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewTechnical analysis shows that the 200 EMA is a dynamic level of resistance that many traders watch closely. A consistent failure to breach this mark can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy where the resistance level grows stronger, as more traders set their sell orders around this key price point.

Ethereum keeps on struggling
Ethereum is showing signs of losing its upward momentum, failing to form a higher high — an indicator that market experts often interpret as a sign of an impending price correction.
The ETH chart reveals a telling pattern; the absence of a new higher high is significant. Typically, in a bullish market phase, the price of an asset creates a series of higher highs and higher lows. However, Ethereum's inability to push beyond its recent peak may suggest that the bulls are running out of steam and a reevaluation of market sentiment could be underway.

Analyzing the chart, the local resistance level has been a tough ceiling for Ethereum to break. This resistance, where sell orders tend to cluster, is acting as a barrier preventing further upward movement. On the flip side, the support level represents a price point with a concentration of buy orders, offering a potential cushion against a price drop. If Ethereum fails to uphold the support level, it could trigger a price breakdown, signaling a shift to a bearish trend.

If Ethereum's price continues to struggle, the scenario could unfold where the asset drops further, testing subsequent support levels. While the underlying fundamentals of Ethereum, such as network upgrades and adoption rates, remain robust, the short-term price action could still be subject to corrective forces.

Solana wants another round
The battleground of volatility on the crypto market continues, and Solana (SOL) has not been spared from its whims. Once a darling of the crypto world for its speed and efficiency, SOL has recently been up against a wall, struggling to surpass the crucial $100 mark. The price chart reflects a narrative of struggle and resistance, painting a picture of an asset in need of momentum.
The technical outlook for SOL is looking promising. After a period of bullish activity that piqued the interest of many investors, SOL has hit a snag near the $100 resistance level. This resistance level represents a significant psychological and financial barrier, as it is where sell orders tend to accumulate, putting downward pressure on the price.

Despite efforts to rally, the asset has been unable to generate the necessary momentum to overcome this threshold with ease and currently consolidates at it. One of the key factors influencing this lackluster performance could be the market's tepid reaction to the announcement of Solana phone Saga 2. The news, which might have been expected to inject some enthusiasm onto the market, failed to provide substantial support for Solana's price.

Looking at the chart, the local support levels are clearly delineated. The first line of defense for SOL lies around the $88-$90 price range, where previous dips have found buyers waiting. Should this level fail to hold, the next support may not emerge until it reaches the more robust $70 level, which could act as a stronger foothold for the price.

Conversely, resistance beyond $100 is now more formidable than ever. With each rejection, the resolve of buyers weakens, and the $100 level transforms from a mere price point into a crucial psychological level you should not miss.

Once a darling of the crypto world for its speed and efficiency, SOL has recently been up against a wall, struggling to surpass the crucial $100 mark. The price chart reflects a narrative of struggle and resistance, painting a picture of an asset in need of momentum.
The technical outlook for SOL is looking promising. After a period of bullish activity that piqued the interest of many investors, SOL has hit a snag near the $100 resistance level. This resistance level represents a significant psychological and financial barrier, as it is where sell orders tend to accumulate, putting downward pressure on the price.

Despite efforts to rally, the asset has been unable to generate the necessary momentum to overcome this threshold with ease and currently consolidates at it. One of the key factors influencing this lackluster performance could be the market's tepid reaction to the announcement of Solana phone Saga 2. The news, which might have been expected to inject some enthusiasm onto the market, failed to provide substantial support for Solana's price.

Looking at the chart, the local support levels are clearly delineated. The first line of defense for SOL lies around the $88-$90 price range, where previous dips have found buyers waiting. Should this level fail to hold, the next support may not emerge until it reaches the more robust $70 level, which could act as a stronger foothold for the price.

Conversely, resistance beyond $100 is now more formidable than ever. With each rejection, the resolve of buyers weakens, and the $100 level transforms from a mere price point into a crucial psychological level you should not miss.

"Ethereum (ETH) Loses All of Its Gains, Bitcoin (BTC) Not Ready to Give up $40,000, Solana (SOL) Comeback Starts","U.Today - Ethereum has wiped out the gains it had accumulated over a sustained period. The ETH/USD price chart depicts a grim narrative as the digital asset has swiftly descended from its peak, retracing back to levels that question the sustainability of its prior growth.

The steep decline in Ethereum's price is a significant bearish signal. It reflects the market's hesitancy to invest at previous highs, most likely due to the underperformance Ethereum has shown in the recent past. This lack of traction and inability to initiate a recovery underscores the vulnerability of Ethereum's price in the current market climate.

ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewFocusing on the technical aspects, Ethereum has broken through what was once seen as a strong support level at approximately $2,350. This price point, which previously saw substantial buying interest, has now been breached, leading to a cascading effect as the asset searches for new support. The next critical support level is around $2,175, where buyers might emerge to stall the downfall.

Conversely, any attempts at recovery will first encounter resistance at around $2,338, a level that now marks the lower boundary of what was a consolidation range before the drop. A close above this level on significant volume could signal a temporary respite from selling pressure. However, the real test lies at higher resistance levels, previously established around $2,500, where ETH struggled to maintain upward momentum.

Bitcoin ready to fight
Recent candlestick formations portray a scenario where Bitcoin is flirting with a critical resistance level, poised to either confirm a bearish trend or start a substantial recovery.
The chart illustrates Bitcoin’s recent descent, as it lost its foothold at the higher price echelons it previously occupied. However, amid this downward movement, Bitcoin is showing signs of resilience. The latest candles indicate a potential reversal as they hover around a significant support level, which can be identified at approximately $37,000, a region where buyers have historically stepped in.

A sustained hold above this point could catalyze renewed buying interest, which may drive the price toward the immediate resistance level at around $41,000. The significance of reclaiming this threshold cannot be understated, as it may invalidate the bearish outlook and signal a trend reversal.

As for the upper resistances, the $43,000 and $46,000 price levels stand out as notable barriers that Bitcoin would need to breach to cement a robust recovery narrative. Achieving such milestones could sway market sentiment positively, potentially ushering in a wave of optimism among investors.

The moving averages offer additional insight, suggesting a possible bullish crossover should the current momentum persist. This scenario would be further supported by a rise in trading volume, which typically accompanies decisive trend shifts.

Solana among leaders
Solana shows signs of a nascent comeback, presenting a bullish scenario amid a broader market recovery. However, investors tread cautiously, aware of the potential of a ""dead cat bounce"" since volume profiles signal restraint.
Analyzing the SOL/USDT chart, we notice that Solana has established a local support level around the $70 price mark. This is characterized by multiple touches of this level over the past few weeks, each time resisting further downward movement.

On the flip side, the local resistance can be identified near the $96 level, which previously acted as support during Solana's consistent upward trend.

The price movement is currently sandwiched between the 50-day moving average acting as dynamic resistance and the 200-day moving average serving as potential dynamic support. The narrowing gap between these averages could squeeze the price action, possibly leading to a volatility breakout.

"Shiba Inu (SHIB) Becoming Bullish, Ethereum (ETH) Price Screams Rally Continuation, Bitcoin (BTC) Not Giving up Market Dominance","U.Today - Shiba Inu currently displays an ascending triangle pattern on the SHIB/USDT chart. This technical formation is widely recognized and could be a signal to a significant price surge for the meme.

An ascending triangle is characterized by a flat upper resistance line and a rising lower support line. This pattern suggests that buyers are gradually gaining ground against sellers, as each dip is bought up at a higher level than the previous one, indicating accumulating pressure for an upward breakout.

SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewFor Shiba Inu, which has been lingering in a period of relatively nonexistent activity, this pattern could serve as massive fuel for volatility in the near future. Recent market conditions have seen a decline in interest toward legacy meme coins, with SHIB being no exception. The lack of significant developments within the Shiba Inu network has contributed to the muted activity around this cryptocurrency.

In contrast, the majority of the action in the meme coin sector has been taking place on the Solana network. This platform has become a hotbed for the deployment of new meme coins, which are exhibiting far greater volatility than those on the Ethereum network, where Shiba Inu resides. The brisk activity on Solana contrasts sharply with the sluggishness observed in Ethereum's meme coin space, drawing in traders and investors looking for quick gains and high excitement.

Ethereum's correction is temporary
The Ethereum market is currently exhibiting a correction, and there are patterns that suggest a rally may not only be on the horizon but could also be in continuation. The asset has recently experienced a sharp downturn, movement that is readily apparent on intraday timeframes. However, such stark movements are often precursors to reversals, signaling that Ethereum could be gearing up for an upswing.
A closer look at the charts shows Ethereum's price action respecting a series of key technical indicators which, together, build a case for potential upward momentum. The asset has been tracing back to touch base with its moving averages, a behavior that is typically followed by a rebound, as these levels can act as dynamic support zones.

This corrective phase is noteworthy, especially considering the robust rally Ethereum enjoyed in the preceding weeks. Corrections are a natural and healthy part of any asset's price trajectory, allowing for consolidation before the next leg up. For Ethereum, the current pullback could be shaking out weak hands, setting the stage for a stronger rally propelled by a more committed investor base.

Bitcoin's dominance not going anywhere
After a brief breach below the 50-day EMA — a critical indicator of medium-term market sentiment — Bitcoin has clawed its way back above this pivotal level. This move indicates a bullish signal for market observers, suggesting that Bitcoin is not yet ready to relinquish its market dominance.
However, the ascent above the 50 EMA has not been met with the kind of vigorous momentum that bulls would hope for. The growth has been moderate, hinting that Bitcoin might encounter selling pressure as it ascends. This is not unusual on the crypto markets, where significant moves often face immediate resistance as traders take profits and skeptics cast doubts.

The recent price action has been a roller coaster for Bitcoin, which saw its value tumble from highs around $47,000 to lows near $41,000. This downturn briefly shifted the spotlight to altcoins, which seized the moment to stage local rallies. The diversification of gains across the crypto spectrum during Bitcoin's periods of weakness is a trend that has become more pronounced as the overall market matures.

Yet Bitcoin's ability to push back above the 50 EMA serves as a reminder of its underlying strength and the confidence investors have placed in it. Despite the opportunity for altcoins to rise, Bitcoin remains the anchor of the crypto market, with its moves often dictating broader market sentiment. This recent rebound above a crucial technical level could be interpreted as Bitcoin's silent assertion that it is not ready to give up the throne just yet.

"Ethereum (ETH) In Dangerous Position, Bitcoin (BTC) About to Lose $40,000, Shiba Inu (SHIB) At Local Support","U.Today - Ethereum finds itself shaky on the edge of a precarious position. The recent price chart indicates a concerning situation: the 26-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a key indicator of short-term momentum, is under threat. If this level fails to hold, Ethereum could see its value dip to the $2,347 mark, a scenario that may well trigger a more pronounced decline.

This potential slip below the 26 EMA is crucial because it suggests a weakening in buying pressure and a shift in market sentiment from accumulation to potential distribution. A break below this level would not only establish $2,347 as the next price floor but could also exacerbate the asset's losses, leading to further bearish momentum.

ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewThe Ethereum ecosystem has faced its share of challenges despite the rise of layer 2-networks, which have not catalyzed the anticipated rally. The broader market has similarly not exhibited the explosive bull run many investors had hoped for, with Ethereum’s trajectory reflecting this subdued market energy.

Additional support and resistance zones can be gleaned from the chart. On the support side, following the $2,347 level, the next critical support lies around $2,175.2 - a breach of which could see ETH test the psychological and technical support near the $2,000 level. Resistance, on the other hand, is firmly established at the recent high of $2,547.6. This price point serves as a litmus test for Ethereum’s ability to rebound and reclaim bullish momentum.

The current market dynamics, marked by cautious trading and a lack of definitive direction, have placed Ethereum in a zone of uncertainty. Investors are advised to monitor these levels closely, as a break below or above these could signal Ethereum's next significant move.

Bitcoin in trouble
Bitcoin finds itself at a precarious juncture as it teeters on the edge of the critical $40,000 mark. The recent price action paints a troubling picture for Bitcoin enthusiasts, with the asset losing its grip on the 50-day Exponential Moving Average, a key support level that has historically indicated bullish sentiment.
As Bitcoin's price struggles to maintain the $40,000 level, the next potential foothold lies at the 100-day EMA. However, this level does not traditionally offer substantial support, and a breach below could precipitate a fall below $39,000, triggering heightened market concern. The chart reveals that the next major support zone stands near the $35,888 mark, a level that buyers might attempt to defend vigorously.

On the resistance front, Bitcoin faces a significant challenge at the $42,786 price level. Overcoming this resistance is crucial for Bitcoin to regain stability and demonstrate potential for a recovery. However, the market currently lacks the necessary liquidity to facilitate a strong rebound, as trading volumes remain relatively low.

Shiba Inu gets hit
The token is currently trading at a local support level, which is a make-or-break situation for its short-term future. A breakdown below this point could spell trouble, signaling a potential decline and testing the resilience of its investor base.
The current market landscape for SHIB is challenging, with a noticeable lack of growth catalysts and low liquidity in the broader cryptocurrency market, both of which could exacerbate the asset's precarious position.

However, there is a glimmer of hope. The descending trading volume accompanying SHIB's price consolidation suggests that bearish momentum could be waning. This deceleration of selling pressure often precedes a stabilization of price, or even a reversal if bulls regain control.

In terms of specific price levels, SHIB is currently finding tentative support around the $0.000027 mark. Should this level fail to hold, the next support zone lies near $0.000022, which may serve as a new accumulation point for buyers. On the resistance side, SHIB faces a hurdle at $0.000035, a breach of which could open the door to a retest of higher levels, possibly around the $0.000040 range.

"XRP Starts Moving Earlier, Solana (SOL) Already Stronger Than Everyone Else; Does Ethereum (ETH) Need More Fuel?","U.Today - XRP appears to have begun its market movements earlier than anticipated. The chart shows a notable shift from the recent sideways trading pattern, as XRP starts to carve out a new direction.

As of the latest trends, XRP has been testing the support level around $0.50, a crucial psychological threshold for the asset. A sustained move below this level could signal further bearish momentum, potentially leading the price to test the next significant support zone around $0.47.

XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewOn the flip side, if XRP manages to stabilize and bounce back from the current support, the initial resistance is likely to be encountered near the $0.54 mark, where the 50-day moving average currently lies. This moving average has historically acted as a dynamic resistance level, and a breakout above could propel XRP toward the $0.56 level, which aligns with the 100-day moving average.

Further complicating the chart is the downward trendline that has been in play since the local high established in November. This trendline has repeatedly acted as resistance, pushing the price downward each time it has been tested. For a true reversal to be confirmed, XRP would need to break above this trendline with significant volume to validate the move.

Solana is leading pack
Solana is manifesting its strength as the top performer among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Despite overall market volatility, SOL's price action has been signaling a stronger recovery compared to other assets.
At the time of analysis, Solana is trading around the $90 mark, having rebounded with considerable momentum from the support level near $78.35. This pivotal point, bolstered by the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), has served as a springboard for the recent bullish trend. The price of SOL has been consistently creating higher lows, indicative of strong buying interest at these levels.

Resistance for SOL is currently looming at the $100 psychological level, a breakthrough of which could propel the price toward the next significant resistance at $110.

The relative strength of Solana is further substantiated by the resurgence of a risk appetite on the market, particularly evidenced by the blossoming of meme coins. This renewed interest in higher-risk assets typically bodes well for ecosystems like Solana that support a variety of decentralized applications and niche crypto projects.

Ethereum needs push
The Ethereum market is currently facing a confluence of challenges as it searches for the momentum to sustain its position. A recent chart analysis reveals an indecisive atmosphere among investors, with Ethereum struggling to find a strong directional move.
At present, Ethereum is hovering around the $2,200 mark, a level that has seen significant activity and is currently acting as a temporary support. However, the lack of bullish conviction suggests that this support level may not hold if a new wave of selling pressure emerges.

Resistance levels are observed near the $2,400 range, where previous attempts to break higher have been met with a firm rejection, indicating a substantial barrier to upward movement.

The selling pressure is partly attributed to the recent news of Celsius Network liquidating approximately $1 billion worth of Ethereum holdings. This substantial amount has the potential to saturate the market, overwhelming current liquidity and triggering a downturn. As a result, the $2,000 psychological level is eyed as the next critical support zone, a breach of which could see a sharp decline toward the $1,950 region, where the 200-day moving average lies, providing stronger historical support.

On the flip side, if Ethereum can absorb the selling pressure and gain the necessary ""fuel,"" a push above the $2,400 resistance could open the path toward the $2,500 area before challenging the more formidable resistance at $2,600, which aligns with the 50-day moving average.

After a period of consolidation, DOGE has broken past a critical resistance level, stirring excitement among traders and investors. The coin is currently sitting above the $0.088 mark, which previously acted as substantial resistance. If DOGE manages to maintain its position above this level, it could solidify this area as new support.

Dogecoin/USDT Chart by TradingViewA break above the $0.095 resistance could signal a continued bullish trend, potentially leading Dogecoin to test the psychological barrier of $0.10. If the momentum is sustained and market sentiment remains positive, DOGE could attempt to reach higher highs, possibly moving toward the $0.105 to $0.11 range last seen during its peak periods of trading activity.

Immediate support for DOGE is now at $0.088 which, if held, could act as a springboard for further climbs. However, should Dogecoin fail to maintain this level, it might fall back to its previous support near $0.078, where buyers have historically shown interest.

A scenario where DOGE's breakout continues would likely involve increased adoption news or a resurgence of interest in meme coins, potentially sparked by social media or celebrity endorsements. Such catalysts could drive demand and push DOGE past the $0.095 level, cementing its breakout status.

Conversely, if the breakout fails to sustain, perhaps due to broader market bearishness or fading interest, DOGE could slide back below $0.088. This would retest the resilience of the $0.078 support. A drop below this level could lead to a bearish phase, with DOGE potentially seeking lower ground.

Solana shows strength
During this market cycle, Solana has established itself as a leader. With its stable and easily scalable performance, it outpaces giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as the majority of DeFi volume went to the ""Ethereum killer.""
As the DeFi ecosystem on Solana flourishes, it is becoming a hub for innovation, blending meme culture with decentralized applications. The network's efficiency and scalability are attracting a wide array of developers.

The cryptocurrency that has been on a strong upward trajectory. Currently, Solana is testing a resistance level at approximately $100, a significant psychological and technical barrier. A convincing break above this level could signal continued bullish momentum, potentially leading to testing the next resistance zone around $108, which coincides with recent highs.

On the downside, the 50-day moving average, sitting near $93.23, is providing dynamic support. This level has been defended multiple times, indicating its importance to traders. If Solana can maintain its footing above this moving average, it would reinforce the asset's stability and could serve as a springboard for further gains.

The next crucial test for Solana will be sustaining above $100. Should it consolidate above this level, it would not be unrealistic to envision a push toward $108, or even higher, as the market reassesses Solana's value proposition in the context of a rapidly evolving DeFi and NFT landscape.

Fundamental Ethereum problems
As it struggles to gain momentum, Ethereum's scalability suffering and the diminishing traction of meme coins on its network are at the forefront of the bearish case for the second-biggest cryptocurrency on the market.
The network's inability to handle high transaction volumes without exorbitant fees has led to the sentiment that Ethereum is becoming ""unusable"" for the day-to-day transactions that meme coins require.

From a technical standpoint, Ethereum's price analysis paints a picture of uncertainty. The asset has been struggling to maintain momentum above crucial support levels. Currently, Ethereum is wavering around the $2,250 mark, with immediate support near the $2,150 level. A break below this support could see a decline toward the $2,000 psychological barrier, which would represent a significant bearish development.

Layer-2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum have emerged as potential stopgaps, offering faster and cheaper transactions. However, their adoption has been less than stellar, with many viewing these platforms as temporary fixes rather than a comprehensive solution to Ethereum's underlying scalability problems.

Ethereum (ETH) Staking Ratio Surprisingly Keeps Surging Despite Shapella,"U.Today - Ki Young Ju, founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, leading on-chain analytical firm, shared his views on the Ethereum (ETH) staking progress. He admits he was wrong about Shapella hard fork's effects.

Ethereum (ETH) staking ratio surges to 24% and counting
Ethereum (ETH) staking ratio, i.e., the percentage of ETH coins locked in staking, reaches 24% and keeps surging. Meanwhile, only 11% of the ETH supply is stored on centralized exchanges. The data was shared by Ki Young Ju on X today, on Jan. 18, 2024.
As such, it is safe to say that the overhyped Ethereum (ETH) upgrade Shapella that allowed stakers to withdraw their coins for the first time since December 2020 did not result in massive unstaking:

Ethereum's (ETH) Shapella was activated in April 2023. As crypto markets were still dominated by bearish sentiment, analysts were expecting withdrawals and consecutive sell-offs of Ethereum (ETH).

The Ethereum (ETH) price also managed to go through this event without significant losses: as stakers withdrew 1 million Ethers (ETH) in first week post-Shapella, the ETH price was fluctuating between $2,000 and $2,100.

Staked Ethereums (ETH) are mostly profitable, Mr. Ki Young Ju adds. While the realized price for staking inflows is $2,014, the current ETH rate is $2,519. As such, the average Ether ""stake"" is being held with a significant 25% profit.

The aggregated volume of the Ethereum (ETH) staking ecosystem is estimated at a whopping $72 billion, with 4.25% in APY, Staking Rewards data says.

Сardano (ADA) staking close to surpassing Solana (SOL)
At the same time, the largest Ethereum (ETH) competitors might be close to a historic ""flippening."" The Solana (SOL) staking ratio is plummeting. The indicator lost over 20% in the last week and dipped below 67%.
Meanwhile, the Cardano (ADA) staking ecosystem added 0.06% in the last seven days and is getting closer to 64%. At the same time, the USD-denominated volume of Solana (SOL) staking is over 200% larger than that of Cardano (ADA).

Out of all mainstream altcoins, Mina Protocol (MINA) demonstrates the largest staking ratio: its stakers locked over 91% of the circulating supply.

Aptos (APT) and Sui (SUI) follow the Mina Protocol (MINA) with 85%-86% in staking ratio.

"Ethereum (ETH) Bullish Momentum to Begin at These Crucial Levels, Says Top Analyst","U.Today - In the ever-evolving landscape of the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum (ETH) has found itself under the scrutiny of analysts as the digital asset hovers around crucial price levels. A prominent figure in the crypto space known as Crypto Tony on X (formerly Twitter) recently shared insights, asserting that Ethereum's bullish momentum could be initiated if it maintains a position above $2,130, with even greater optimism should it reclaim the range high at $2,500.

As of the latest market data, Ethereum is currently priced at $2,262, reflecting a modest 1.22% increase over the past 24 hours. However, the cryptocurrency has experienced a 4.29% decrease over the last 30 days, showcasing the volatility inherent in the market. The trading volume for ETH has notably surged by 75.24% in the last 24 hours, reaching $9,626,210,522, indicating heightened activity and interest in the digital asset.

Crypto Tony's emphasis on the $2,130 and $2,500 thresholds aligns with the sentiment of many Ethereum enthusiasts, who closely monitor these levels as potential catalysts for a sustained bullish trend. The cryptocurrency community eagerly waits to see if Ethereum can not only maintain but surpass these critical levels in the coming days.

Potential bullish catalyst
In a related development, the Ethereum network is on the verge of a major upgrade, known as the Prague upgrade or Pectra upgrade. This imminent update has generated considerable buzz within the Ethereum community, as it promises substantial enhancements and alterations to the platform. The Prague upgrade is anticipated to introduce improvements in scalability, security and overall functionality, which could positively impact Ethereum's price trajectory.
The potential bullish effect of the Prague upgrade on ETH's value has sparked discussions among investors and analysts, with some speculating that the impending changes could serve as a catalyst for a price surge, propelling Ethereum above current levels.

While the market remains dynamic and unpredictable, the confluence of technical analysis highlighting key price levels and the anticipation of a major network upgrade contributes to the growing intrigue surrounding Ethereum's future price movements. Market participants are closely monitoring the developments, ready to capitalize on potential opportunities as ETH navigates these crucial junctures in the ever-evolving crypto landscape.

Will This Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Pattern Start Reversal?,"U.Today - Shiba Inu is currently showcasing a price pattern that could potentially lead to a reversal. The pattern, characterized by SHIB breaking below the 200-day Exponential Moving Average, might be indicating an opportune moment for investors and traders to consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) into their positions.

The 200-day EMA is a critical long-term indicator that many investors watch to determine market trends. A break below this line can often suggest bearish sentiment. However, for the astute investor, this can also present an attractive entry point, especially for those looking to DCA or accumulating during dips in anticipation of future gains.

Despite the current breach, SHIB's approach to this level has historically been met with a strong reaction from buyers, sometimes resulting in a notable price reversal. If the pattern holds true to its historical behavior, the price of SHIB may soon find sufficient support to halt the decline and initiate an upward trajectory.

Nonetheless, it is crucial to acknowledge that SHIB has been facing consistent selling pressure, evident every time there is an attempt to push the price higher. This consistent sell-off following attempts to rise has created a challenging environment for SHIB to sustain any substantial gains.

The current market scenario for SHIB is a delicate balancing act between bearish pressure and the potential for a bullish reversal. For new investors looking to enter the market, the area just below the 200 EMA could prove to be a significant level, provided they are comfortable with the inherent risks involved with such volatile assets. Older investors can use the price level to dollar cost average their holdings.

Solana loses steam
Solana (SOL), the blockchain platform known for its speed and efficiency, has recently experienced a significant breakdown, signaling a pause in the bullish momentum that had characterized its market behavior. After a prolonged uptrend, the correction has aggravated into a more pronounced price fall, indicating a shift in market sentiment.
The chart reveals that Solana has decisively exited its previous uptrend, characterized by higher highs and higher lows, and has entered a correction phase. The volume profile during this downturn suggests that the selling pressure has intensified, leading to a breakdown below critical support levels. This pattern is often a precursor to further declines as market confidence wanes.

For those looking for a scenario in which Solana could rebound, a relief rally could emerge from oversold conditions, indicated by RSI approaching lower bounds. Such a rally would require a catalyst, possibly in the form of positive developments within the Solana ecosystem or broader crypto market sentiment shifts. A rebound scenario might also be supported by traders looking for value buys at lower price points, thus creating sufficient buying pressure to counter the recent downtrend.

Ethereum meets substantial support
Ethereum has recently encountered a significant level of support, touching the 50-day Exponential Moving Average, a critical indicator for determining local trends.
The 50-day EMA has historically been a stronghold for Ethereum's price, acting as a pivot point between the bullish and bearish territories. After a period of decline, Ethereum's approach to this level suggests that we may be on the cusp of a reversal. This is particularly compelling given Ethereum's past performance, where touches of the 50 EMA have often led to a resurgence in buying activity, driving the price upward.

Currently, the intersection with the 50 EMA aligns with a descending trading volume, indicating a potential decrease in selling pressure. This trend could signify market consolidation before a bullish reversal, as lower volume alongside support touchpoints often precedes a shift in momentum.

The implications of this volume decrease are twofold. First, it may suggest that the recent sell-off is losing steam, and the market is running out of sellers at current price levels. Second, it may imply that the market is awaiting further catalysts or developments within the Ethereum ecosystem, such as updates on Ethereum 2.0 or broader crypto market trends, before initiating the next significant move.

Ethereum (ETH) at Critical Juncture as Michaël van de Poppe Predicts Bullish Breakout,"U.Today - In the ever-evolving landscape of the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum (ETH) finds itself at a critical juncture, with renowned crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe predicting a potential bullish breakout. In a recent tweet, van de Poppe conveyed his insights, indicating that Ethereum was approaching the low of 2022 and was likely to absorb liquidity at that level.

He expressed the belief that in the event of a spot ETF approval for Bitcoin (BTC), there would potentially be a liquidation candle on the trading chart for the ETH/BTC trading pair. Following this, analyst van de Poppe foresaw a rotation of funds into Ethereum, accompanied by a bullish weekly divergence.

According to the most recent data, Ethereum is presently valued at $2,294, indicating a noteworthy 3.04% uptick in the past 24 hours. The trading volume within this period has experienced a substantial surge, escalating by 36.14% and peaking at $12.48 billion. In the aftermath of this modest rally, ETH has observed $21.60 million in short liquidations and $11.79 million in long liquidations, as reported by CoinGlass.

Spillover effect
The focal point of van de Poppe's analysis revolves around the potential approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The cryptocurrency market anticipates a breakthrough, with BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), a financial behemoth, leading the charge. BlackRock, along with other prominent firms such as Grayscale Investments, Valkyrie and ARK 21Shares, has recently submitted updated 19b-4 filings for their proposed spot Bitcoin ETFs.
Market sentiment is building as BlackRock expresses confidence in the SEC's approval for its spot Bitcoin ETF, with expectations pointing toward a potential decision as early as this Wednesday. A positive outcome could trigger a ripple effect in the broader cryptocurrency market, impacting not only Bitcoin but also potentially leading to a rotation of funds into Ethereum.

Michaël Van de Poppe's prediction hinges on the notion that Bitcoin spot ETF approval may prompt a notable uptrend for Ethereum. Traders and investors are closely monitoring these developments, recognizing the interconnected nature of cryptocurrencies and the potential spillover effects of major regulatory decisions. As Ethereum stands at this critical juncture, the market awaits further clarity from regulatory bodies and key players in the cryptocurrency space.

"Samson Mow Issues Ultra-Bullish Bitcoin Statement, Dogecoin Whale Moves 332.9 Million DOGE to Binance, Michaël van de Poppe Predicts Bullish Breakout for ETH: Crypto News Digest by U.Today","U.Today - U.Today has prepared a summary of the top three news stories over the past day.

Ultra-bullish Bitcoin statement made by Samson Mow ahead of possible ETF approval
As the crypto community is eagerly awaiting the SEC's decision regarding the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, Bitcoin maximalist Samson Mow took to X platform to share his mega-bullish expectations on BTC's price movement. According to Mow, Bitcoin reaching $1 million may happen any day from now, and this sudden price surge will be “max pain” for most market participants. He explained that many companies, including his own, Jan3, have many plans and meetings scheduled for the year 2024, and should Bitcoin spike to $1 million, it would “derail everything.” Apart from Jan3, Mow named other big figures in the crypto space who would see their plans collapse in the event that BTC suddenly reached $1 million: analyst Plan B and his stock-to-flow model for Bitcoin, MicroStrategy with its goal to accumulate 1% of the Bitcoin supply and El Salvador, as it would not be able to issue Bitcoin bonds and buy more BTC below the $100,000 level.
Dogecoin (DOGE) whale transfers 332.9 million DOGE to Binance
According to data provided by Whale Alert's X account, yesterday, a Dogecoin (DOGE) whale moved a large amount of dog-themed tokens to Binance. The transaction carried 332,931,620 DOGE (worth $26,612,151 at the time of transfer) from an unknown wallet to the aforementioned major exchange. It remains unclear what motivated the whale to make such a significant transfer, and Dogecoin enthusiasts are speculating about its potential implications for the broader DOGE ecosystem. Meanwhile, DOGE has seen a decline in its value, going down by 21.98% over the past 30 days. The Dogecoin community is looking forward to further developments, both in terms of the whale's activities and the impact of the recent lunar launch on DOGE's market dynamics. As a reminder, on Jan. 8, a real replica of the dog-themed token was sent to the moon onboard the Vulcan Centaur rocket.
Ethereum (ETH) at critical juncture as Michaël van de Poppe predicts bullish breakout
In a recent X post, renowned crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe made a prediction about a potential bullish breakout for Ethereum (ETH), as the second-largest cryptocurrency currently finds itself in a critical position. According to van de Poppe, ETH is approaching the low of 2022 and is likely to take liquidity at that level. The analyst believes that in case a spot Bitcoin ETF gets approved by the SEC, there would potentially be a liquidation candle on the trading chart for the ETH/BTC trading pair. After this, van de Poppe foresees a rotation of funds into Ethereum, along with a bullish weekly divergence. Michaël Van de Poppe's forecast is predicated on the idea that Ethereum could see a significant rise in response to the approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF. Thus, traders are keeping a close eye on the upcoming Bitcoin ETF decision, recognizing the interconnected nature of cryptocurrencies.

Ultra-bullish Bitcoin statement made by Samson Mow ahead of possible ETF approval
As the crypto community is eagerly awaiting the SEC's decision regarding the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, Bitcoin maximalist Samson Mow took to X platform to share his mega-bullish expectations on BTC's price movement. According to Mow, Bitcoin reaching $1 million may happen any day from now, and this sudden price surge will be “max pain” for most market participants. He explained that many companies, including his own, Jan3, have many plans and meetings scheduled for the year 2024, and should Bitcoin spike to $1 million, it would “derail everything.” Apart from Jan3, Mow named other big figures in the crypto space who would see their plans collapse in the event that BTC suddenly reached $1 million: analyst Plan B and his stock-to-flow model for Bitcoin, MicroStrategy with its goal to accumulate 1% of the Bitcoin supply and El Salvador, as it would not be able to issue Bitcoin bonds and buy more BTC below the $100,000 level.
Dogecoin (DOGE) whale transfers 332.9 million DOGE to Binance
According to data provided by Whale Alert's X account, yesterday, a Dogecoin (DOGE) whale moved a large amount of dog-themed tokens to Binance. The transaction carried 332,931,620 DOGE (worth $26,612,151 at the time of transfer) from an unknown wallet to the aforementioned major exchange. It remains unclear what motivated the whale to make such a significant transfer, and Dogecoin enthusiasts are speculating about its potential implications for the broader DOGE ecosystem. Meanwhile, DOGE has seen a decline in its value, going down by 21.98% over the past 30 days.

"Ethereum (ETH) Jumps 11.4%, Here's How Whales Are Changing Game","U.Today - There is ongoing mega accumulation of Ethereum (ETH) by whales within the crypto ecosystem. According to data from the crypto analytics platform Lookonchain, a whale with the wallet address ""0xAA15"" withdrew a total of 5,762 ETH worth approximately $15.06 million from Binance earlier today. Overall, this whale has bought a total of 50,733 ETH $99.2 million at an average price of $1,955 since Sept. 19, 2023.

Per the Lookonchain outlook, another whale, ""0x9314"" also spent 7.29 million USDT to buy 2,800 ETH today, joining the host of accumulations of the second-largest cryptocurrency about two hours ago. This particular whale has a more robust portfolio, having stacked up a total of 82,780 ETH worth approximately $150.3 million at an average price of $1,816 since Jan 1, 2023.

The intriguing switch to Ethereum by these whales complements the $8.2 billion in large transaction volumes according to data from IntoTheBlock. These large transactions, which involve ETH worth at least $100,000, have jumped by 65.99% in the past 24 hours.

Ethereum’s whales are notably helping to change the game as the digital currency strives to recoup its lost ground to price action.

Ethereum price in mix
At the time of writing, Ethereum has jumped by 11.42% in the past 24 hours to $2,645.07. The cryptocurrency has grown from a 24-hour low of $2,353.93 to its price at the moment, driven in part by the hype ravaging the market following the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
This approval is boosting sentiment that the spot Ethereum ETF might also be on the way. This has further pushed retail sentiment as well, with Ethereum now notably eyeing the $2,700 benchmark.

"XRP, BTC, ETH Show Surprising Profitability Trend, Biggest Signal to Watch","U.Today - According to on-chain analytics firm Santiment, major cryptocurrencies Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP are displaying an intriguing profitability trend.

In a new tweet, Santiment noted that Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP Ledger all have more than 80% of existing supplies in profit. This trend was last observed in March 2022. Bitcoin, ETH and XRP are presently marking 83%, 84% and 81% of their supplies in profit.

The ""Total Supply in Profit"" metric is an excellent way to determine how much the total supply on a network is up or down at any given time. This is a simple technique to determine whether a coin is worth more or less today than it was when it was initially minted, mined or entered circulation.

Meanwhile, the percent of total supply in profit analyzes whether the percentage of supply available at any particular time, rather than the total number of coins on a network, is up or down at any given time. This represents a binary way of seeing the ratio of the total supply simply being in profit, even if it is a very small profit.

That said, Santiment states that BTC, XRP and ETH have their supplies at historically high-risk profit levels compared to their averages, which have been in the 55%-75% range since 2018.

The percentage of total supply in profit offers shorter-term perspectives on how the network is profiting or losing value on its investments over time.

This matters because crypto is a zero-sum game. When networks are heavily profiting, according to this metric, then it is imperative to watch out.

This does not rule out further upside moves for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies due to more exposure from ETFs and other positive news; however, there might be something else to watch out for.

According to Santiment, a great signal to watch that would imply continued long-term growth would be a breach below 75% of their supplies in profit once again.

"Here's Who Burned 9,001 ETH in Last 30 Days","U.Today - Uniswap, the world’s largest decentralized exchange, is apparently a top burner of Ethereum, with a staggering 9,001 ETH incinerated from the circulating supply in the last 30 days. This activity firmly positions Uniswap as a key player in the Ethereum ecosystem, not just in terms of volume but also in influencing the coin's scarcity.

The mechanism behind Ethereum's burn is a recent upgrade known as EIP-1559, which introduced a transaction fee burn for every operation made on the network. Uniswap, as the leading DEX, handles a massive volume of transactions, naturally leading to a higher rate of ETH being burned. This burn acts as a deflationary force on the supply of Ethereum, theoretically creating scarcity that could bolster the asset's value over the long term.

ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewHowever, the correlation between burn rate and immediate price action is not linear. While Uniswap's significant contribution to the burn rate underscores its dominance, the short-term impact on Ethereum’s price is subdued. Over a longer horizon, this deflationary mechanism is expected to establish a supportive base for the price of ETH, as reducing supply, ceteris paribus, should increase the value of each remaining ETH.

It is important to note, though, that scarcity alone does not guarantee value growth. The intrinsic value of Ethereum also hinges on its utility, adoption and broader market sentiment. Currently, Ethereum is facing stiff competition from Solana in ecosystem growth, with many traders who favor volatility and risk gravitating toward Solana.

A technical analysis of Ethereum's current price action shows a challenging market phase. Ethereum is attempting to hold support around the $2,400 level. Should it fail to sustain this, the next key support is observed at the $2,300 mark, near the 50-day EMA. A breach below this could see Ethereum test the $2,000 psychological support level. Conversely, if Ethereum can rally past the immediate resistance at $2,500, it could pave the way to retest previous highs near $2,800.

Bitcoin and Ethereum Bulls Taking Control: $60 Million of Shorts Liquidated Ahead of Weekend,"U.Today - The cryptocurrency market is witnessing a strong bullish momentum as Bitcoin and Ethereum bulls start to assert control. In a significant development, shorts worth approximately $60 million have been liquidated, signaling a potential shift in market sentiment as we approach the weekend.

Analyzing the current charts, Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience, managing to sustain above the crucial support level of $40,000. The coin has recently experienced a rebound from this level, which has historically acted as a strong psychological barrier for both bulls and bears.

Source: CoinglassIf BTC maintains its position above this support, the next key resistance to watch will be around $42,000, a level where we might expect some consolidation before a further push. On the downside, if the $40,000 level fails to hold, traders should look for potential support near the $38,500 region.

Ethereum, on the other hand, is also showing signs of recovery after a recent sell-off. The coin has found support near the $2,100 mark, just above the 200-day exponential moving average, which is often considered a significant indicator of long-term trends.

If ETH can sustain this rebound, the immediate resistance is expected at $2,400. A breakthrough above this could open the path toward $2,500, a level that previously acted as both support and resistance. A fall below the current support level could see the price testing the next support zone around $2,000.

The liquidation heatmap provides additional context, illustrating the pressure on short sellers as the market moves against their positions. This liquidation is particularly evident in the case of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have seen a significant number of short positions being closed in a short span of time. Overall, the market is currently displaying bullish signs, with strong support levels holding up.

"Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin Makes Surprising Visit to Binance, New CEO Richard Teng Shares","U.Today - In an unexpected turn of events, Ethereum (ETH) cofounder and prominent figure in the cryptocurrency industry, Vitalik Buterin, paid a surprise visit to the Binance office. The revelation came from the CEO of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, Richard Teng, who shared the news on his X page.

Teng expressed his gratitude for the privilege of hosting Buterin.

The impromptu meeting sparked a flurry of speculation within the crypto community, as enthusiasts and experts alike pondered the potential collaboration between these two giants of the crypto market. Notably, Binance has been grappling with heightened regulatory scrutiny in recent months, leading to the legal predicament of its former CEO, Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao.

Vitalik and Binance connections
This unexpected rendezvous holds significance, given Buterin and Binance's history of active collaboration, such as Buterin's contribution to the proof-of-reserves concept for centralized crypto exchanges just two years ago. Against the backdrop of Binance's $4 billion fine and ongoing regulatory challenges, the nature of the discussions between Buterin and the Binance team remains shrouded in mystery.
Vitalik Buterin's recent focus, as evident in his essay titled ""Make Ethereum Cypherpunk Again,"" centers on security, privacy and scalability. Notably, he addressed concerns about centralized exchanges and their vulnerability to hacking — a topic that adds fuel to the speculation of potential collaborative efforts between Buterin and Binance.

As the crypto community eagerly awaits further developments, the surprise visit has sparked intense discussions about the future direction of these industry heavyweights.

Ethereum (ETH) Needs These 3 Crucial Factors to Align for Growth: Details,"U.Today - Despite Ethereum's position as a frontrunner in the altcoin sector, its growth has been stunted by a bearish trend that has held a tight grip on the market in recent weeks. A closer look at the ETH chart reveals that the expected volatility spike that could catalyze a bullish reversal has yet to materialize.

Layer-2 network adoption and ecosystem expansion
First, the surge of layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism could be a catalyst for Ethereum's growth. These networks aim to enhance Ethereum's ecosystem by providing the much-needed scalability and reduced fees, potentially driving renewed interest and increased adoption of the Ethereum network.
ETH/USD Chart by TradingView

Scalability and network efficiency
Second, Ethereum's persistent scalability issues must be addressed. Despite the implementation of EIP-1559, which was anticipated to make transaction fees more predictable, the network still struggles under high demand, leading to exorbitant fees and reduced network functionality. Resolving these scalability woes is crucial, as a more efficient and cost-effective network is vital for Ethereum to retain its value and utility.
Introduction of Ethereum ETF
Finally, the establishment of an Ethereum ETF would be a strong bullish signal, mirroring the impact of the Bitcoin ETF. An Ethereum ETF would pave the way for institutional investment, providing a regulated and accessible means for traditional investors to gain exposure to ETH. This could secure Ethereum's future as a mainstream financial asset and provide a stable foundation for long-term growth.
Looking at the Ethereum chart, we identify a local resistance level at approximately $2433.5, a price point that has acted as a hurdle in recent trading sessions. For a bullish case to solidify, Ethereum needs to break past this resistance with conviction. Should this occur, it could signal a shift in investor sentiment and open the path to higher price levels.

Self-Proclaimed Satoshi Craig Wright Takes Dig at Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin,"U.Today - In an unexpected turn of events today, self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto Craig Wright took a swipe at Ethereum's creator, Vitalik Buterin. Wright revisited a series of posts by Buterin in 2017, where he discussed the early versions of the Ethereum protocol.

Back then, Buterin had responded to a question about the possibility of building Ethereum on top of Bitcoin, expressing concerns about potential conflicts with Bitcoin's development team. He cited fears that protocol rules might change, making it difficult for him to build on a base protocol at odds with his vision.

Fast forward to January 2024, and Wright seized the opportunity to comment on Buterin's past remarks. He argued that Ethereum only exists due to centralized development teams that have the power to alter the protocol. Wright mused about the hypothetical scenario of having everything built on Bitcoin, envisioning a more streamlined and less fragmented system.

Bitcoin v. Ethereum
Wright's comments add fuel to the longstanding rivalry between Bitcoin and Ethereum, highlighting fundamental differences in their approaches to decentralization and protocol governance.
While Ethereum has achieved considerable success as a platform for smart contracts and applications, Wright argues for the stability and originality of Bitcoin's protocol.

Moreover, it revives the centralization debate in both cryptocurrency ecosystems. On the one side is OFAC's censorship of ETH transactions; on the other side is the enormous concentration of BTC in the hands of whales and miners.

In his latest post on X, he took a subtle jab at alternative investment assets, including Silver and Ethereum (ETH), as his way of reducing their viability in comparison to their counterparts Gold and Silver.

Samson Mow analogy
According to Samson Mow, Silver is the poor man’s Gold, a statement that shows that investors who consider the latter to be too expensive typically opt in for the former. While both are respected metals and investment assets, Gold is still considered the superior of the two.
Samson Mow deflated Ethereum’s ego to end the long-standing superiority debate with Bitcoin. The vocal investor noted that ""Ethereum is the stupid man's Bitcoin,"" a statement that spooked members of the ETH community.

By valuation, Bitcoin’s market cap currently stands at $809,923,408,001, while that of Ethereum comes in at $297,575,053,741. The price differentials of $41,344.01 to $2,476.66 also show that Bitcoin is the most valuable of the two. Over time, there have been conversations about shifting capital from BTC to ETH, a trend that might be amplified in the coming months if Ethereum’s key fundamentals come into play.

The harsh criticism of Ethereum did not go down well with its community members, with some pointing out the key improvements the protocol has made as a blockchain in itself.

Is XRP next?
As a Bitcoin Maxi, Samson Mow was asked by one of the commenters on his post what he thinks about XRP if Ethereum is the poor man’s Bitcoin. He simply answered that the demand is a ""tricky one.""
Samson Mow’s confidence in Bitcoin has made him forecast a $1 million price target, and his lack of confidence in XRP and Ethereum has undoubtedly made his bearish stand subtle.

Ethereum (ETH) Faces Serious Bug; Here's Who Might Be Affected,"U.Today - Ethereum is potentially facing a significant bug that has emerged, previously only assumed as a hypothetical scenario in discussions among the developer and validator community back in March 2022, but now it looms as a potential threat that could become a reality.

This bug concerns the Ethereum staking mechanism and how the network reaches consensus. In essence, if a majority client, holding more than 2/3 of the stake, has a bug, it could inadvertently build an invalid chain that the network would consider finalized due to the majority stake's ""agreement.""

If validators running this buggy client commit to this incorrect chain, any attempt to switch to a correct chain could result in severe penalties due to how the Ethereum protocol is designed to penalize what it sees as ""equivocating"" validators.

What makes this situation particularly alarming is the scale of the potential impact. If this bug manifests, the validators could find themselves in a predicament where they either continue to support an incorrect chain or switch to a correct one at great personal cost. The validators running the buggy client would face a dilemma: lose their stake through penalties or persist with an invalid chain, endangering the network's integrity.

For the average Ethereum holder not involved in staking or blockchain development, this might seem distant, but the implications can be far-reaching. An individual commented that the situation is ""pretty scary,"" and it is also the main reason why they do not stake any ETH. This sentiment reflects a potentially surging concern among holders who fear the ripple effects a bug of this magnitude could have on the network's trust and stability.

Centralized exchanges (CEXes), although well capitalized, might also feel the effect of potential finalization issues. Though their liquidity is far more resilient, mitigating large losses might still become an issue.

"Ethereum Whale Moves $46 Million in ETH Across Binance, Bitfinex and Aave: Details","U.Today - In a surprising move that has captured the attention of the cryptocurrency community, an Ethereum (ETH) whale has orchestrated a series of transactions involving major exchanges, moving a staggering $46.02 million in ETH over the past two days. The entity, utilizing a network of eight wallets, withdrew funds from Binance and Bitfinex before staking with Lido, a liquid staking solution.

Blockchain analytics platform Spot On Chain first brought attention to the substantial transactions through a tweet, revealing intricate details of the massive ETH movement. The whale withdrew the Ethereum holdings from crypto exchanges Binance and Bitfinex at an average price of approximately $2,419.

Subsequently, five wallets were employed to withdraw 50.15 million USDT from Aave, a prominent DeFi protocol, to the CEX trading platform, exchanging the stablecoin for 19,021 ETH, equivalent to the $46.02 million value. Spot On Chain further disclosed that three wallets still retained around 30 million USDT in Aave, sparking speculation that they might deposit these funds into a CEX soon, potentially acquiring more ETH.

Ethereum price struggles
The timing of these transactions coincided with a challenging period for the Ethereum market. At the time of the whale's activity, the price of ETH struggled, recording a 4.57% dip in the last 24 hours and a 9.46% decline in the past week. Current market data indicates ETH trading at $2,296.
Coinglass, another analytics platform, reported a significant amount of liquidations for ETH within the last 24 hours, totaling $53.78 million. Of this amount, $47.48 million resulted from long liquidations, while short liquidations accounted for $6.29 million. The liquidation data underscores the volatility and uncertainty prevalent on the market, with traders experiencing significant losses.

Market analysts and enthusiasts are closely monitoring these developments, as such large-scale transactions from influential entities often lead to speculation and conjecture regarding potential market impacts. Traders and investors are advised to exercise caution and stay vigilant as the cryptocurrency landscape continues to unfold, revealing the dynamics of this rapidly evolving market.

Ethereum (ETH) Becomes Target of Massive $1 Billion Sell-Off: Who's Responsible?,"U.Today - Ethereum is encountering a massive sell-off exceeding $1 billion. The source of this enormous market movement can be traced back to Celsius, which reportedly transferred a staggering 459,561 ETH, valued at approximately $1.014 billion, to various exchanges.

The distribution of this sell-off was as follows: 297,454 ETH ($656.5 million) moved to Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) Prime, 146,507 ETH to Paxos Treasury and smaller amounts of 7,800 ETH each, totaling $17.2 million, were transferred to FalconX and Coinbase. Despite this massive transfer, Celsius reportedly retains a reserve of 62,468 ETH, worth around $139 million.

Such a colossal sale exerts immense pressure on Ethereum's price and could significantly sway market sentiment. The immediate concern for investors and traders is whether Ethereum's liquidity and market capitalization can absorb such a hit without triggering a broad market downturn.

From a technical analysis standpoint, the massive outflow from Celsius is a bearish signal, likely to test Ethereum's local support levels. A crucial support to watch is around the $2,000 price range, a psychological and technical support level, which, if breached, could see the price tumble to the next significant support at $1,800. This level has historically acted as a strong buy zone and may serve as a robust defense against further declines.

Conversely, resistance levels have become more formidable due to the sell-off. Any potential recovery will have to confront the resistance at $2,200, which previously acted as a support level. A break above this could see Ethereum attempt to reclaim higher price levels, possibly testing the $2,400 resistance.

The substantial sell-off initiated by Celsius has placed Ethereum in a problematic position. Although the Ethereum network's fundamentals remain robust, the asset's price resilience in the face of such a significant sell-off shows the actual state of the market.

Major FED Decision to Affect Crypto Market in Two Days,"U.Today - The crypto market is bracing itself as the Federal Reserve gears up to announce its first interest rate decision of 2024. The whispers from the CME about a 96.9% chance to keep interest rates unchanged are causing ripples. Yet, with the second decision in March casting a 47% shadow of a rate cut by 25 basis points (bps), investors are on edge. Adding to the economic fervor, the United States is set to release the January unemployment rate, which could further sway market sentiment.

The Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates is a critical economic lever that traditionally influences traditional markets and, as has been seen, the cryptocurrency market as well. An unchanged interest rate could maintain the status quo, possibly keeping investment steady in assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

A cut, however, could signal economic caution, potentially reducing the attractiveness of risk assets like cryptocurrencies or, conversely, could lead investors to seek higher returns in the crypto market if traditional investments falter.

BTC/USD Chart by TradingViewAnalyzing the Bitcoin chart, there is a distinctive ""war"" between the bulls and bears. The immediate resistance level to watch is around the $42,500 mark, which Bitcoin has been testing recently. This level is crucial because a decisive close above it could signal increasing bullish momentum. On the downside, the support level at approximately $39,528, aligning with a psychological round number and a previous area of interest, is one that traders are likely to defend vigorously.

The upcoming Fed decision could serve as a catalyst for Bitcoin's next big move. If interest rates remain unchanged, Bitcoin could continue to test the resistance level, and a break above could confirm a bullish reversal. However, should rates decrease, Bitcoin's reaction might be even more unpredictable.

"Shiba Inu (SHIB) Rapidly Breaks Down, Ethereum (ETH) Loses Traction, While Solana (SOL) Presents Hidden Opportunity","U.Today - Shiba Inu has experienced a significant breakdown from its recent consolidation phase. The chart depicts a clear downward trajectory as SHIB failed to maintain its position within the ascending triangle pattern it had formed over the past few months.

The breakdown was signaled as SHIB prices breached the key support level at $0.000009, which had previously acted as a reliable floor for the price during consolidation phases. Following this, SHIB prices tumbled further, slicing through subsequent support near $0.0000087. This price action marked a decisive shift in market sentiment from accumulation to distribution.

SHIB/USDT Chart by TradingViewThe next support level to watch is at $0.0000082, where SHIB may find a temporary reprieve from the selling pressure. If this level fails to hold, the next critical support lies at $0.0000076, which could serve as the last line of defense before a more significant drop.

For a reversal to occur and for SHIB to regain its upward momentum, it would need to reclaim previous support levels and transform them back into supports. This would require a substantial influx of buying pressure, potentially sparked by positive developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem or broader cryptocurrency market rallies.

The first sign of a possible reversal would be a return above $0.0000087, followed by a sustained move above the $0.000009 price level. A breakout above these levels, accompanied by increasing volume, could indicate that the downtrend is losing steam and that bulls are regaining control.

Solana paints reversal pattern
Solana has been developing a subtle yet potentially pivotal chart pattern. The asset has been tracing a slow and steady ascending channel, a formation that suggests a controlled and consistent uptrend. This pattern, characterized by higher lows and higher highs contained within two parallel trendlines, speaks to potential for continued growth.
The significance of this pattern lies in the momentum it could provide for SOL. Should the price action remain strong within the upper half of the channel, and particularly if it challenges the upper trendline, we could see Solana break through and embark on a more aggressive rally.

Such a bullish scenario would likely be supported by increased trading volume and positive developments within the Solana ecosystem, such as new project launches or updates that enhance network performance.

The immediate local resistance stands at around $55, and a confident push beyond this could confirm bullish sentiment. Inversely, if Solana's price dips below the channel's lower boundary, around $48, it could indicate that a bearish narrative is taking hold.

Ethereum momentum decreasing
Ethereum is exhibiting signs of waning momentum, as observed in recent price movements. The asset, which has long been considered the backbone of the decentralized finance sector, is facing a pivotal moment that could determine its trajectory for the coming weeks.
The provided chart illustrates Ethereum's struggle to maintain its grasp on the market. The price has been on a downward trend, edging closer to the local 26-day Exponential Moving Average. This level, currently near $2,465, is critical; if Ethereum fails to hold this line, we might see it descend to test the more significant 50 EMA, which stands around the $2,300 mark.

The 26 EMA serves as a short-term sentiment gauge, and its breach could signal a lack of immediate bullish support. Should this level fail to act as a springboard for price recovery, Ethereum's next stop could indeed be the 50 EMA. A breach below this longer-term moving average could potentially open the gates for a test of lower support levels, highlighting the need for investors to brace for more volatility.

Market participants are now recalibrating their expectations, understanding that the road to sustainable gains is a long-term journey.

"XRP's Epic Battle Against Bears, Solana Breaks $100, While Ethereum Fights for Momentum","U.Today - XRP is currently locked in a fierce struggle with bearish forces. The digital asset, which operates within the Ripple network, is experiencing difficulty establishing a position above a critical technical indicator — the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).

The 200 EMA serves as an important barometer for the long-term trend and investor sentiment. For XRP, remaining below this level suggests that the asset lacks the bullish momentum needed to shift into an upward trajectory. This inability to secure a foothold above the 200 EMA raises questions about the stability of positive price action in the near term.

XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewTechnical analysis shows that the 200 EMA is a dynamic level of resistance that many traders watch closely. A consistent failure to breach this mark can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy where the resistance level grows stronger, as more traders set their sell orders around this key price point.

Ethereum keeps on struggling
Ethereum is showing signs of losing its upward momentum, failing to form a higher high — an indicator that market experts often interpret as a sign of an impending price correction.
The ETH chart reveals a telling pattern; the absence of a new higher high is significant. Typically, in a bullish market phase, the price of an asset creates a series of higher highs and higher lows. However, Ethereum's inability to push beyond its recent peak may suggest that the bulls are running out of steam and a reevaluation of market sentiment could be underway.

Analyzing the chart, the local resistance level has been a tough ceiling for Ethereum to break. This resistance, where sell orders tend to cluster, is acting as a barrier preventing further upward movement. On the flip side, the support level represents a price point with a concentration of buy orders, offering a potential cushion against a price drop. If Ethereum fails to uphold the support level, it could trigger a price breakdown, signaling a shift to a bearish trend.

If Ethereum's price continues to struggle, the scenario could unfold where the asset drops further, testing subsequent support levels. While the underlying fundamentals of Ethereum, such as network upgrades and adoption rates, remain robust, the short-term price action could still be subject to corrective forces.

Solana wants another round
The battleground of volatility on the crypto market continues, and Solana (SOL) has not been spared from its whims. Once a darling of the crypto world for its speed and efficiency, SOL has recently been up against a wall, struggling to surpass the crucial $100 mark. The price chart reflects a narrative of struggle and resistance, painting a picture of an asset in need of momentum.
The technical outlook for SOL is looking promising. After a period of bullish activity that piqued the interest of many investors, SOL has hit a snag near the $100 resistance level. This resistance level represents a significant psychological and financial barrier, as it is where sell orders tend to accumulate, putting downward pressure on the price.

Despite efforts to rally, the asset has been unable to generate the necessary momentum to overcome this threshold with ease and currently consolidates at it. One of the key factors influencing this lackluster performance could be the market's tepid reaction to the announcement of Solana phone Saga 2. The news, which might have been expected to inject some enthusiasm onto the market, failed to provide substantial support for Solana's price.

Looking at the chart, the local support levels are clearly delineated. The first line of defense for SOL lies around the $88-$90 price range, where previous dips have found buyers waiting. Should this level fail to hold, the next support may not emerge until it reaches the more robust $70 level, which could act as a stronger foothold for the price.

Conversely, resistance beyond $100 is now more formidable than ever. With each rejection, the resolve of buyers weakens, and the $100 level transforms from a mere price point into a crucial psychological level you should not miss.

This inability to secure a foothold above the 200 EMA raises questions about the stability of positive price action in the near term.

XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewTechnical analysis shows that the 200 EMA is a dynamic level of resistance that many traders watch closely. A consistent failure to breach this mark can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy where the resistance level grows stronger, as more traders set their sell orders around this key price point.

Ethereum keeps on struggling
Ethereum is showing signs of losing its upward momentum, failing to form a higher high — an indicator that market experts often interpret as a sign of an impending price correction.
The ETH chart reveals a telling pattern; the absence of a new higher high is significant. Typically, in a bullish market phase, the price of an asset creates a series of higher highs and higher lows. However, Ethereum's inability to push beyond its recent peak may suggest that the bulls are running out of steam and a reevaluation of market sentiment could be underway.

Analyzing the chart, the local resistance level has been a tough ceiling for Ethereum to break. This resistance, where sell orders tend to cluster, is acting as a barrier preventing further upward movement. On the flip side, the support level represents a price point with a concentration of buy orders, offering a potential cushion against a price drop. If Ethereum fails to uphold the support level, it could trigger a price breakdown, signaling a shift to a bearish trend.

If Ethereum's price continues to struggle, the scenario could unfold where the asset drops further, testing subsequent support levels. While the underlying fundamentals of Ethereum, such as network upgrades and adoption rates, remain robust, the short-term price action could still be subject to corrective forces.

Solana wants another round
The battleground of volatility on the crypto market continues, and Solana (SOL) has not been spared from its whims. Once a darling of the crypto world for its speed and efficiency, SOL has recently been up against a wall, struggling to surpass the crucial $100 mark. The price chart reflects a narrative of struggle and resistance, painting a picture of an asset in need of momentum.
The technical outlook for SOL is looking promising. After a period of bullish activity that piqued the interest of many investors, SOL has hit a snag near the $100 resistance level. This resistance level represents a significant psychological and financial barrier, as it is where sell orders tend to accumulate, putting downward pressure on the price.

Despite efforts to rally, the asset has been unable to generate the necessary momentum to overcome this threshold with ease and currently consolidates at it. One of the key factors influencing this lackluster performance could be the market's tepid reaction to the announcement of Solana phone Saga 2. The news, which might have been expected to inject some enthusiasm onto the market, failed to provide substantial support for Solana's price.

Looking at the chart, the local support levels are clearly delineated. The first line of defense for SOL lies around the $88-$90 price range, where previous dips have found buyers waiting. Should this level fail to hold, the next support may not emerge until it reaches the more robust $70 level, which could act as a stronger foothold for the price.

Conversely, resistance beyond $100 is now more formidable than ever. With each rejection, the resolve of buyers weakens, and the $100 level transforms from a mere price point into a crucial psychological level you should not miss.

"XRP Is Surprisingly Stable, Here's Why","U.Today - XRP is currently holding above the crucial 200-day EMA, a level that has morphed into a dynamic support line. This pivotal line, sitting approximately at $0.55, is now the battleground where XRP's short-term destiny is being contested.

In recent days, XRP's price action has been characterized by its struggle to overcome a series of local resistance levels. A notable rejection was faced around the $0.63 mark, which has added to the narrative of an asset under pressure. Despite these rejections, the asset's ability to stay afloat above the 200-day EMA suggests underlying strength and potential for growth.

XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewThe market's oppressiveness toward XRP can be attributed to various factors, including lack of usecase for XRP and a poor performance throughout the 2023. However, the past has shown that XRP can swiftly shift from oppressed states to strong bullish rallies, often catching many off-guard.

For a scenario where XRP's growth continues, it is essential for the token to maintain its stand above the 200-day EMA. If this level holds, it can serve as a springboard for future bullish attempts. A decisive close above this moving average could stimulate investor confidence, potentially leading to a challenge of the recent resistance at $0.63. A break and hold above this level could signal a trend reversal and may pave the way for XRP to target higher resistances, possibly around the $0.70 to $0.75 regions.

Solana is back in uptrend
Solana is showing signs of entering an uptrend once more. The recent price chart reveals a pattern of resilience, with Solana forming a higher low that indicates a potential shift in market sentiment.
After dipping to a support level around $88 on December 20, 2023, Solana has rebounded, forming a higher low near the $90 mark. This movement suggests accumulating strength and a possible change in direction from the previous downward trend. The local trendline resistance, which Solana is currently testing, is evident at approximately $97.50.

Two pivotal price levels stand out on Solana's chart. The first resistance level after the trendline sits near the $100 psychological mark. This round number has historically been a challenging point for Solana to breach decisively. Beyond that, the $104 level looms as the next significant barrier, which was a previous local high around January 3, 2024.

Conversely, on the support side, the level to watch is around $88, as mentioned earlier. This price has proven to be a firm foundation, with buyers stepping in to uphold Solana's valuation. A secondary support level is present near $85, just below the 50-day moving average, acting as a safety net for any potential retracements.

Ethereum's dominance prevails
Ethereum swiftly cuts through resistance levels with a bullish fervor that has not been seen in recent times. After a spirited 8.8% pump, Ethereum has confidently surpassed the $2,500 and $2,600 milestones, setting its sights firmly on the next major resistance level at $3,000.
The rapid growth witnessed in the past few days has been nothing short of impressive. Ethereum, which lingered around the $2,400 mark in the early days of February, has seen a significant influx of buying pressure, leading to a breakthrough past key resistance levels. This positive price action posits two potential scenarios for the smart contract giant.

In one scenario, Ethereum could continue its aggressive push, riding the wave of current market optimism towards the $3,000 target. If this momentum is maintained, and with the additional fuel from the recent high volume of trades, ETH could test $3,000 in the coming days. A consolidation above $2,600 would be crucial for this scenario to unfold, as it would establish a new support level, reinforcing investor confidence.

Alternatively, given the volatile nature of the crypto markets, a retracement could occur before Ethereum reaches $3,000. This would likely see the asset retesting support at the $2,500 level, which if held, could serve as a springboard for a second wave towards and beyond $3,000.

"Ethereum (ETH) Loses All of Its Gains, Bitcoin (BTC) Not Ready to Give up $40,000, Solana (SOL) Comeback Starts","U.Today - Ethereum has wiped out the gains it had accumulated over a sustained period. The ETH/USD price chart depicts a grim narrative as the digital asset has swiftly descended from its peak, retracing back to levels that question the sustainability of its prior growth.

The steep decline in Ethereum's price is a significant bearish signal. It reflects the market's hesitancy to invest at previous highs, most likely due to the underperformance Ethereum has shown in the recent past. This lack of traction and inability to initiate a recovery underscores the vulnerability of Ethereum's price in the current market climate.

ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewFocusing on the technical aspects, Ethereum has broken through what was once seen as a strong support level at approximately $2,350. This price point, which previously saw substantial buying interest, has now been breached, leading to a cascading effect as the asset searches for new support. The next critical support level is around $2,175, where buyers might emerge to stall the downfall.

Conversely, any attempts at recovery will first encounter resistance at around $2,338, a level that now marks the lower boundary of what was a consolidation range before the drop. A close above this level on significant volume could signal a temporary respite from selling pressure. However, the real test lies at higher resistance levels, previously established around $2,500, where ETH struggled to maintain upward momentum.

Bitcoin ready to fight
Recent candlestick formations portray a scenario where Bitcoin is flirting with a critical resistance level, poised to either confirm a bearish trend or start a substantial recovery.
The chart illustrates Bitcoin’s recent descent, as it lost its foothold at the higher price echelons it previously occupied. However, amid this downward movement, Bitcoin is showing signs of resilience. The latest candles indicate a potential reversal as they hover around a significant support level, which can be identified at approximately $37,000, a region where buyers have historically stepped in.

A sustained hold above this point could catalyze renewed buying interest, which may drive the price toward the immediate resistance level at around $41,000. The significance of reclaiming this threshold cannot be understated, as it may invalidate the bearish outlook and signal a trend reversal.

As for the upper resistances, the $43,000 and $46,000 price levels stand out as notable barriers that Bitcoin would need to breach to cement a robust recovery narrative. Achieving such milestones could sway market sentiment positively, potentially ushering in a wave of optimism among investors.

The moving averages offer additional insight, suggesting a possible bullish crossover should the current momentum persist. This scenario would be further supported by a rise in trading volume, which typically accompanies decisive trend shifts.

Solana among leaders
Solana shows signs of a nascent comeback, presenting a bullish scenario amid a broader market recovery. However, investors tread cautiously, aware of the potential of a ""dead cat bounce"" since volume profiles signal restraint.
Analyzing the SOL/USDT chart, we notice that Solana has established a local support level around the $70 price mark. This is characterized by multiple touches of this level over the past few weeks, each time resisting further downward movement.

On the flip side, the local resistance can be identified near the $96 level, which previously acted as support during Solana's consistent upward trend.

The price movement is currently sandwiched between the 50-day moving average acting as dynamic resistance and the 200-day moving average serving as potential dynamic support. The narrowing gap between these averages could squeeze the price action, possibly leading to a volatility breakout.

"Ethereum (ETH) In Dangerous Position, Bitcoin (BTC) About to Lose $40,000, Shiba Inu (SHIB) At Local Support","U.Today - Ethereum finds itself shaky on the edge of a precarious position. The recent price chart indicates a concerning situation: the 26-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a key indicator of short-term momentum, is under threat. If this level fails to hold, Ethereum could see its value dip to the $2,347 mark, a scenario that may well trigger a more pronounced decline.

This potential slip below the 26 EMA is crucial because it suggests a weakening in buying pressure and a shift in market sentiment from accumulation to potential distribution. A break below this level would not only establish $2,347 as the next price floor but could also exacerbate the asset's losses, leading to further bearish momentum.

ETH/USD Chart by TradingViewThe Ethereum ecosystem has faced its share of challenges despite the rise of layer 2-networks, which have not catalyzed the anticipated rally. The broader market has similarly not exhibited the explosive bull run many investors had hoped for, with Ethereum’s trajectory reflecting this subdued market energy.

Additional support and resistance zones can be gleaned from the chart. On the support side, following the $2,347 level, the next critical support lies around $2,175.2 - a breach of which could see ETH test the psychological and technical support near the $2,000 level. Resistance, on the other hand, is firmly established at the recent high of $2,547.6. This price point serves as a litmus test for Ethereum’s ability to rebound and reclaim bullish momentum.

The current market dynamics, marked by cautious trading and a lack of definitive direction, have placed Ethereum in a zone of uncertainty. Investors are advised to monitor these levels closely, as a break below or above these could signal Ethereum's next significant move.

Bitcoin in trouble
Bitcoin finds itself at a precarious juncture as it teeters on the edge of the critical $40,000 mark. The recent price action paints a troubling picture for Bitcoin enthusiasts, with the asset losing its grip on the 50-day Exponential Moving Average, a key support level that has historically indicated bullish sentiment.
As Bitcoin's price struggles to maintain the $40,000 level, the next potential foothold lies at the 100-day EMA. However, this level does not traditionally offer substantial support, and a breach below could precipitate a fall below $39,000, triggering heightened market concern. The chart reveals that the next major support zone stands near the $35,888 mark, a level that buyers might attempt to defend vigorously.

On the resistance front, Bitcoin faces a significant challenge at the $42,786 price level. Overcoming this resistance is crucial for Bitcoin to regain stability and demonstrate potential for a recovery. However, the market currently lacks the necessary liquidity to facilitate a strong rebound, as trading volumes remain relatively low.

Shiba Inu gets hit

However, there is a glimmer of hope. The descending trading volume accompanying SHIB's price consolidation suggests that bearish momentum could be waning. This deceleration of selling pressure often precedes a stabilization of price, or even a reversal if bulls regain control.

In terms of specific price levels, SHIB is currently finding tentative support around the $0.000027 mark. Should this level fail to hold, the next support zone lies near $0.000022, which may serve as a new accumulation point for buyers. On the resistance side, SHIB faces a hurdle at $0.000035, a breach of which could open the door to a retest of higher levels, possibly around the $0.000040 range.

"XRP Starts Moving Earlier, Solana (SOL) Already Stronger Than Everyone Else; Does Ethereum (ETH) Need More Fuel?","U.Today - XRP appears to have begun its market movements earlier than anticipated. The chart shows a notable shift from the recent sideways trading pattern, as XRP starts to carve out a new direction.

As of the latest trends, XRP has been testing the support level around $0.50, a crucial psychological threshold for the asset. A sustained move below this level could signal further bearish momentum, potentially leading the price to test the next significant support zone around $0.47.

XRP/USDT Chart by TradingViewOn the flip side, if XRP manages to stabilize and bounce back from the current support, the initial resistance is likely to be encountered near the $0.54 mark, where the 50-day moving average currently lies. This moving average has historically acted as a dynamic resistance level, and a breakout above could propel XRP toward the $0.56 level, which aligns with the 100-day moving average.

Further complicating the chart is the downward trendline that has been in play since the local high established in November. This trendline has repeatedly acted as resistance, pushing the price downward each time it has been tested. For a true reversal to be confirmed, XRP would need to break above this trendline with significant volume to validate the move.

Solana is leading pack
Solana is manifesting its strength as the top performer among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Despite overall market volatility, SOL's price action has been signaling a stronger recovery compared to other assets.
At the time of analysis, Solana is trading around the $90 mark, having rebounded with considerable momentum from the support level near $78.35. This pivotal point, bolstered by the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), has served as a springboard for the recent bullish trend. The price of SOL has been consistently creating higher lows, indicative of strong buying interest at these levels.

Resistance for SOL is currently looming at the $100 psychological level, a breakthrough of which could propel the price toward the next significant resistance at $110.

The relative strength of Solana is further substantiated by the resurgence of a risk appetite on the market, particularly evidenced by the blossoming of meme coins. This renewed interest in higher-risk assets typically bodes well for ecosystems like Solana that support a variety of decentralized applications and niche crypto projects.

Ethereum needs push
The Ethereum market is currently facing a confluence of challenges as it searches for the momentum to sustain its position. A recent chart analysis reveals an indecisive atmosphere among investors, with Ethereum struggling to find a strong directional move.
At present, Ethereum is hovering around the $2,200 mark, a level that has seen significant activity and is currently acting as a temporary support. However, the lack of bullish conviction suggests that this support level may not hold if a new wave of selling pressure emerges.

Resistance levels are observed near the $2,400 range, where previous attempts to break higher have been met with a firm rejection, indicating a substantial barrier to upward movement.

The selling pressure is partly attributed to the recent news of Celsius Network liquidating approximately $1 billion worth of Ethereum holdings. This substantial amount has the potential to saturate the market, overwhelming current liquidity and triggering a downturn. As a result, the $2,000 psychological level is eyed as the next critical support zone, a breach of which could see a sharp decline toward the $1,950 region, where the 200-day moving average lies, providing stronger historical support.

On the flip side, if Ethereum can absorb the selling pressure and gain the necessary ""fuel,"" a push above the $2,400 resistance could open the path toward the $2,500 area before challenging the more formidable resistance at $2,600, which aligns with the 50-day moving average.

The relative strength of Solana is further substantiated by the resurgence of a risk appetite on the market, particularly evidenced by the blossoming of meme coins. This renewed interest in higher-risk assets typically bodes well for ecosystems like Solana that support a variety of decentralized applications and niche crypto projects.

Ethereum needs push
The Ethereum market is currently facing a confluence of challenges as it searches for the momentum to sustain its position. A recent chart analysis reveals an indecisive atmosphere among investors, with Ethereum struggling to find a strong directional move.
At present, Ethereum is hovering around the $2,200 mark, a level that has seen significant activity and is currently acting as a temporary support. However, the lack of bullish conviction suggests that this support level may not hold if a new wave of selling pressure emerges.

Resistance levels are observed near the $2,400 range, where previous attempts to break higher have been met with a firm rejection, indicating a substantial barrier to upward movement.

The selling pressure is partly attributed to the recent news of Celsius Network liquidating approximately $1 billion worth of Ethereum holdings. This substantial amount has the potential to saturate the market, overwhelming current liquidity and triggering a downturn. As a result, the $2,000 psychological level is eyed as the next critical support zone, a breach of which could see a sharp decline toward the $1,950 region, where the 200-day moving average lies, providing stronger historical support.

On the flip side, if Ethereum can absorb the selling pressure and gain the necessary ""fuel,"" a push above the $2,400 resistance could open the path toward the $2,500 area before challenging the more formidable resistance at $2,600, which aligns with the 50-day moving average.
